This game is my first owned Call of Duty game(because I don't own a PS3 or 360). I think it is amazing. I am sad that the Wii version is missing split screen mode, as I was looking forward to that, but my multiplayer online experience has been awesome. The graphics are surprisingly good for a Wii game, and the gameplay matches it beautifully. My only complaint is the current glitch which causes some people to get corrupted save files.
