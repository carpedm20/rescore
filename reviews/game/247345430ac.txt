I liked BF4 when I started it, it seemed like a good and polished game. Naturally I just hopped into multiplayer, played a few matches and everything went pretty well. Later right after I shot down a helicopter with a stinger, my game just froze. I thought it was just my x-box, so I turned the game back on and played a few matches and it did it again. Now I was infuriated! I scanned reviews on amazon, and sure enough, other people where having this problem.PLEASE FIX THEESE FREEZES
