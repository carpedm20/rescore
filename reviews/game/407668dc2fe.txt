 okay, i'm just gonna say, this is a terrible game. not because of the stupid reason that it's "a repackaged mw2". although it kinda is, it's also just not fun at all. online got boring after 1 hour, campaign wasnt very enjoyable, and the only high point of the game is spec ops. the survival mode is somewhat fun which is why i'm giving it a 1. do NOT buy this game, a waste of money
