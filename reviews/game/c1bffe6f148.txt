To paraphrase Alfred North Whitehead, all 3D platformers are but footnotes to Super Mario 64.  With Super Mario Galaxy, Nintendo tries to reinvent the genre it defined."Galaxy" looks great; fantastic graphics leave future developers no room to blame sloppy visuals on hardware limitations.  The game's structure involves multiple hubs from which players go to different worlds ("galaxies") where they complete missions to earn stars.  The missions are brief (rarely longer than 15 minutes or so), but this conciseness is achieved through a sharp focus on objectives.  Many of the tasks play out in a linear fashion as the mission keeps Mario on a particular path from one planetoid to the next until he reaches his goal.  This may feel constraining to those who wish they could explore a given galaxy at will.Besides the new gameplay, Mario now finds himself right-side up, upside-down, and sideways relative to your television screen.  Though an interesting concept, sometimes-counterintuitive joystick controls make the experience more cumbersome than it should be.  In addition, the computer-controlled camera restricts the field of view such that looking around an area for something particular (switches, coins, even oncoming enemies) can be next to impossible--perhaps the game's one genuine design flaw.Super Mario Galaxy somewhat lacks the pick-up-and-play simplicity that characterized Mario 64, but there is still much to appeal to players who appreciate the gameplay style and are willing to master the niceties of controlling Mario in his new intergalactic environment.  "Galaxy" is a deft demonstration of the Wii's potential and worth a look for system owners.~
