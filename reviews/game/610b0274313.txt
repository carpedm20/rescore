The IGN review (i.e. score of 45) is one of the worst reviews in the history of video gaming. IGN is typically a trusted source for reviews but for this one they just went on one of their "PS3 and Xbox are so much better" rants. If you only have a Wii console and love FPS action (particularly multi-player), this the greatest Wii game in its short history of FPS gaming. The graphics are actually good, believe it or not, and the game play is non-stop fun. The experience with Wii Mote and Wii Zapper is so different and superior to those "button-based, non-trigger" controllers and I encourage all to try it. I rate this game a "90" and not a "45" per IGN, the "Debbie Downer" of Wii video game reviews.
