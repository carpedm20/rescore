This is a response I posted in the AC2 Sales, but I wanted to also add to the one star rating here as well.Thanks.I sure hope that all the publicity for this DRM garbage will make someone think in Ubisoft. The higher price for this game is nonstandard, but would not keep me from buying it. The DRM however does. Imagine the money lost from all us that will not buy this product because of the DRM. At $60 a pop, (no tax included) $600 for 10 people... etc, etc. I know several people that would have bought this game, and I am sure many of us reading this know several more people that would buy it. Piracy can not be stopped... there are people out there that piracy is their line of work only. It is a given, companies know this. They should have known better, soak up the cost of piracy with providing a product that a good honest consumer will pay their hard-earned money for. I am one of those people that believe whole heartedly that good products produce people that don't mind paying for it, supporting the company that work hard delivering it.For this, I would love to see Ubisoft take the dive, and go bankrupt for such stupidity!!!
