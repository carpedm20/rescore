Look, I love the game, but after two corrupted save files wiping out my campaign save, I just feel cheated. There are some sections of the campaign which are mundane, I don't mind getting through them once, even twice after the first corruption. However I never want to pay those sections again, so will never get the opportunity to complete the campaign. There is no excuse considering how many people hit the same issue, either they knew about it and still pushed it out to make launch day, or they did a rubbish job in QA. Â£55 for a beta, that's a joke. It's a shame as I love the game to bits, but will not be buying another version out of principle.
