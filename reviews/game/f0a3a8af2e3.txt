This review is strictly for the horrible DRM, which is actually tied to the components in your PC, not the whole PC itself.  Put simply, if you upgrade ANY component in your PC (Such as the CPU, graphics card, hard drive or RAM) you will be unable to play the game you LEGALLY PURCHASED.  Let me repeat that, if you make any changes to the hardware in your PC, the DRM will inform you you have reached your activation limit (The DRM limits you to 3 installions) and WON'T LET YOU PLAY THE GAME.
