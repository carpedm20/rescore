In a word, Awesome. The graphics are amazing, the frame rate is amazing, multiplayer is amazing. I was in an Obliteration game for two and a half hours, that is the definition of epic. The Shanghai map is absolutely amazing when the building falls down and it completely changes the map for the better. Granted the game is not perfect, Conquest is, at the moment, is not working, but should be working by next week according to Dice. The campaign is not the best, but to be honest 99% of your time is spent playing multiplayer anyway. It does have some of the launch title woes, but you come to expect them when your an early adopter of a new console.
