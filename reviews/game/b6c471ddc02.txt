First of all I have played the old COD 1 en 2 on the pc. Those two are the best COD's and they are from the times that infinity ward and activision gave a damn about their consumers. Back when you paid 60$ for a full game and no 15$ map packs, back when the developers made actual expansion packs with new story line and new maps and not only 4 maps. So after such a long time I decided to get the newest installment because they hired a good writer to write this game. (I have not played black ops or any of the other cod's) The sad thing is that Activision hired Stephen Gaghan to do the writing but there isn't much dialogue in this game. You basically have an idea of what the story is about but you are shooting most of the time, there is no connections with the characters and the campaign is too short. The missions are varied but we have seen them in the previous COD's. All COD's have climbing down from a window and then shoot the guys inside the room, the snow missions are getting repetitive, the underwater mission is nice but we also had that. Also the 40gb install and 6gb of ram are just lazy coding or maybe all the DLC's are already installed and need a 15$ code to unlock it. The multiplayer is just a recycle of previous modern warfare's it seems: Same animation kill, reloading animation, same guns and knifing feels like you poke someone. The kill streaks are stupid because you can see the enemy on the radar and the dog attack is just overpowered. LOOKING FORWARD TO BLACK OPS 3 NEXT Year, SAME TIME, SAME PLACE :s
