Let me start by saying I wanted this game, I haven't played CoD since MW2. I was excited for some arcade style shooting. Then came the release... WHAT A NIGHTMARE. I pre-loaded the game 3 days before but for some reason had to spend another 6 hours downloading the game!! It was on release night, a night I reserved for gaming by leaving early from work Well, the next day I got to finally play the game. "You do not meet specified RAM requirements" WHAT A LOAD OF BS!!! I have 6GB of physical ram that I installed myself. I know it is there! They created a artificial wall to the game, because the game doesn't actually use or require a full 6gb of ram. They bloated their specs so they could look like they were competing on a graphical scale of BF4. (which by the way, BF4 doesn't block you if you have 4gb of ram, plus it looks better and has bigger maps) BTW I used RAMFIX and was able to play single player on ultra settings with no problems... 6gb or higher of ram my a$$! ABSOLUTE FAIL IN EVERY CATAGORY FROM ACTIVISION AND INFINITYWARD!!!
