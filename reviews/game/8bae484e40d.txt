Once again, any semblance of a single-player experience is tossed out the window so a bunch of preadolescents can waste months of their lives online.  It's on rails, the enemies come from the same place every time and after awhile it's just plain boring.  And that's the best I can say about this huge waste of time and money.  When the original Metal Gear Solid on a 20 year old platform is BETTER than this over wrought piece of crap, that's saying something.  I don't care about cut scenes.  I don't care about "realism."  I want a GREAT playing experience...and this ain't it.
