I've always been a FPS fan. I've played all the COD's, BF, Halo's etc. I really liked BF3, with a few minor complaints, but overall a favorite so I was excited for this to come out. A lot of reviewers talking about the washed out colors and lack of texture and they are completely right. Even on a gaming monitor through HDMI and on all graphics settings I feel like I'm playing a XBOX (original) game. The online matching system is a joke. The weapon customization is frustrating and hard to figure out at first. I'm halfway through the campaign and it's just ok. Usually BF games have an awesome story-line while other FPS games I buy for multiplayer, but I'm debating just stopping now. It's a bit boring.For how much I was excited for this game, I'm really disappointing. I hope I don't get let down by COD ghosts as well.Edit: A lot of the problems I had have since been fixed. Still not 100% happy with it, but it's enjoyable to play now. Still think the game engine is a bit lacking as the physics are not quite realistic. The campaign, which I still haven't finished -almost done, gets better. Matchmaking is a lot less buggy. I still haven't gotten into the game like I have with other BF games, but I felt I needed to remove the 1 star rating.
