This game is full of glitches. The 1st time I tried to play the campaign, the game froze up on me three times. The third time, it lost my campaign data and I had to start over. The second time I tried to play the campaign, it wouldn't let me progress through some points because there were enemies getting stuck in walls and I couldn't kill them. The enemy AI allows them to throw grenades with devastating precision. Anytime I ducked behind cover to regain health a grenade landed right next to me and killed me. One of the glitches that was most annoying was when I climbed a ladder on the aircraft carrier I got flung out into the middle of the ocean.  That happened to me several times. This game is going to be a big DNF for me and I'm going trade it in and put the money down on another game.
