Activision would prefer to build games that do not require servers, since servers cost money.  The alternative is to have one of the players in each game act as a server (host).  In several other games the host gains an advantage because other players experience a short delay in receiving data from the host.  To try and combat the host advantage, MW3 and Black Ops use lag compensation.  Lag compensation attempts to put everyone on a level playing field by predicting player actions and have the host put the puzzle back together later.  Unfortunately, this method has created a very frustrating environment for gamers. On your side you may take several shots when going 1-on-1 with another player, but with lag compensation you may lose without the game showing you took a single shot (I recommend you youtube 'MW3 lag compensation').Lag compensation ruined that last call of duty game (Black Ops) and it continues to do so in Modern Warefare 3. If multiplayer is the main reason you are picking this game up, then please read reviews from other online gamers before purchasing.  Call of Duty has been a series with record sales for each release, so there isn't much incentive for Activision to fix this major issue with game play.  As a consumer, I regret contributing to this games sales records and I will not be making that mistake again in future releases.
