I am CoD fan from the first game. After this, not anymore. They lied to us. They say this is going to be The Best game ever. Not for me. Minimum pc requirement to play this game OS: Windows 7 64-Bit Windows 8 64-Bit CPU: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E8200 2.66 GHZ AMD Phenom™ X3 8750 2.4 GHZ or better RAM: 6 GB RAM HDD : 40 GB HD space Video: NVIDIA® GeForce™ GTS 450 ATI® Radeon™ HD 5870 or better Sound: DirectX® compatible sound card DirectX®: DirectX® 11 Internet: Broadband connection and service required for Multiplayer Connectivity. Internet connection required for activation. are just lame. Price of 60 Us dollars or 60 Euros is to much for the game that is purely MP. Four hour of SP huge disappointment, Not to say that Hardened Edition is 120 Us Dollars or Euros. In one word this is just BAD! I am sorry but you lost me as a future buyer of your new games. In ten years Activision and Infinity Ward are crossed from game making company to money greeding company. I gave you score 2 just for effort. It is not everything lost, just million or two player who can't start the game because or minimum system requirements.
