Having played the Battlefield 4 Beta, it was a refreshing and exciting wait for Battlefield 4 to come out. I preordered it for Xbox 360 and patiently waited. The big day came today when the package delivered. After downloading the necessary 2 GB install I divulged in. I quickly realized through my estimated 3 hours of play that this game is garbage, at least for current gen consoles. The graphics are rudimentary. Dropping frames constantly is quite the ordinary thing to notice when playing multiplayer. There is no option to squad up with friends, which you'd think it being 2013, wouldn't be a key issue overlooked. When you try to bypass this and find a match so your friend can join session; you'll have about a 40% success rate in using quick match as it'll either freeze your whole Xbox or put you in a lobby all by yourself, never with the intention of populating it. I had a particular instance where I tried to join a team deathmatch, only to bizarrely enter a Domination match. If you think that trying to find a correct server to join is the better option, you'll also encounter these issues and more. All the servers list as empty and even the ones that list as populated are always somehow full, even when tweaking with key search settings. This game, for having a beta is one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had. I put the disc back in the case and have no intention of wanting to play it again. The support of this has been nill and my requests to their community manager, support twitter and ea customer service has gone ignored. They simply say the problem has been addressed and will be fixed "soon". Soon? The two weeks this beta was out wasn't enough time? Dice is an embarrassment and I hope those looking to buy a copy take into consideration my review and save their money. You're not missing anything, trust me. I'd give this lower than 1 star if given the choice.
