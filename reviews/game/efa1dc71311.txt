Have been a fan of the ANNO series for a while, and still regularly play 1701 & 1404. However the moronic decision by UbiSoft to impose this "always-on" DRM scheme has made ANNO 2070 the most difficult game to deal with out of the hundreds I own. It seems AAA publishers are out to kill PC gaming in favor of consoles, because I can honestly think of no other reason a company would willingly subject paying customers to these kind of headaches. Recently UbiSoft's servers went down for a lengthy period making ANNO 2070 and several other newer titles unplayable during that time.I purchased the game on day one of that downtime (ANNO 2070 was not supposed to be affected), meaning no access to a game I had just payed for. The game itself is basically what one would expect if you are familiar with the ANNO series, except instead of taking place in a historical setting, we are propelled to a "hard" science fiction world. The change of pace is nice, graphics and gameplay are top-notch. In short, it continues the ANNO tradition admirably.However, when taking into account the always-on DRM, the need to create a "U-Play" account (on top of Steam), and the massive amount of fail due to the server transfer and subsequent downtime, I cannot see why anyone would want to pay $50 to subject themselves to the hassle. It is time companies stopped treating their paying customers as potential criminals. No other industry is so invasive in terms of restricting access to a paid product than PC gaming and AAA publishers, and even with EA's recent move to the annoying exclusivity and heavy handed Origin, UbiSoft takes the proverbial cake when it comes to making you jump through hoops just to play a game you paid good money for.For myself, ANNO 2070 will be the last UbiSoft title I will be purchasing, unless the company stops treating its paying customers so poorly.Gameplay 7/10DRM 1/10
