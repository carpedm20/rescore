Graphics may seems as dated at the beginning (oh man, the caves are sooo fugly), but you will discover soon what amazing work had developers put into the scenery and interiors design. And it works quite smooth on my old mid-end hardware. Annoying loot and mobs leveling seems to be fixed now, since loot is more rare and mobs are more dangerous. Skyrim doesn't force you to follow main story line as Oblivion did, and you are free to travel around from the beginning. Controls are somewhat limited on PC (and hotkeys are TERRIBLE), but it seems as I can cope with it. The game is like a Morrowind on the steroids. It's a bit more free, more open-world, less generic-medieval than Oblivion. AI is less annoying, dialogs are well-written, voice acting is terrific and everything seems much more alive. This game is indeed a big step forward both in the terms of the gameplay and design. Long live the king!
