I was very interested in purchasing this game due to the appeal of exploring a 15th Century Venice. But after reading about the ridiculous DRM scheme, however, I will boycott this game until Ubisoft adopts a DRM no more restrictive than a "disk check" requirement. When it does, I will buy it and happily immerse myself in its world for entertainment.Aside from the potential technical pitfalls (e.g., limited internet connection or Ubisoft server failure), what about the privacy issues? Why would I care to share my game playing statistics with Ubisoft?In this recession, our dollars now are more valuable than ever. So vote with your dollars and boycott this ill-advised DRM scheme. Ubisoft (and its competitors ) will get the message! Amazon should get wise as well and advocate for its customers by red-flagging draconian DRM and encouraging game companies to treat paying customers with greater respect.I just purchased Mass Effect 2 because it was $30 and EA only requires a disk check (according to our fellow Amazon posters).Thanks for the Heads-Up about Ubisoft's highly invasive DRM!Bible & Sword
