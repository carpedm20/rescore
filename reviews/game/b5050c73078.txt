Wow, this game is cool. I have a Samsung 50" DLP 1080p and this game looks great. It is the most photo-realistic console game I have ever played; The colors are rich and textured very well.Game play is fun. The single player campaign is shorter than some games but still worth every penny. The weapons are cool and the levels are beautiful. I can only ask that it is longer.Multiplayer is awsome. Compared to Halo 3, I prefer Call of Duty 4. Not that  I think Halo 3 sucks, It is just a matter of what style of game play I prefer.The fact that you have to earn weapons and weapon upgrades is appealing to me, it keeps me coming back. The waiting time for a match is short unlike the 5-10 minute waits in Call of Duty 3.The sub-machine guns are weak in this game. The AK47 is horribly inaccurate, the M-16 is too powerful, the Barrett .50 cal sniper doesn't always kill in one shot, and sometimes you get spawned right in front of the enemy, which can be annoying. Give it a shot, good game.
