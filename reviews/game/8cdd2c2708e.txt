this game is as boring as it is in ps3 and xbox the campaing is short and repetitive as always in the cod series....... but once said that i think its a good game the controls work very well as always on wiis fps, the IGN review is **** and graphics are nice, top ps2..........so its a good game...... stop hating morons and try to be honest and responsible, this game is as bad as in other platforms no more no less..................my rating would be 6.5 but i give a 10 to compensate stupid trolls...... fawk you !!!!
