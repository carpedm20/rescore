Awesome, so you just spent $60 on the hot new game from a major publisher from this trusted online retailer. You install it on your laptop as you spend a lot of time on a train/bus/plane, and a game is the perfect way to pass the time. Hold on... it's not loading... wait, what's this about needing a high speed connection just to load and save the game? How does that work??It's ok though, I'm not sure how much data this uses from your monthly data cap (if it has to be a high speed connection and sends all your game saves to the server, I would imagine quite a bit) but it's worth it. Inside the box is a cheque from UbiSoft for the bandwidth the game uses, and the fact you can't play A SINGLE PLAYER GAME when not constantly connected to the net. OK, there isn't a cheque... I made that up.Is your net connection a bit weak? It's alright, the game will automatically pause the game while potentially losing any new progress until it's better again... and we all know that every internet connection, especially wireless, is that reliable.I hope all you evil, vicious and immoral pirates have learned your lesson and will never download anything that doesn't come chained to the publisher again! Sure, UbiSoft had to get tough on you to send that message home (at least for the 5 hours it apparently took to crack the DRM), but since you're the only ones that are able to play the game while the UbiSoft server has been up and down the last few days, and the people who shelled out $60 legally for it cannot, let us know how it is! :)rAy
