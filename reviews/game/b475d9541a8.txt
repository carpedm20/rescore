I played Black Ops 2 with all Settings on ultra with about 160fps. Battlefield 4 Beta with around 100fps. Now here comes Ghosts. It doesnt look too sexy at high details but even at ulta low settings it has a framerate from under 60. Best features of this game: - you often spawn under the map in mid-air. - performance on some 2.000$ PCs is so poor, that you actually can't play the game. - There is NO OPTION to display fps - There is NO OPTION to display ping - There is NO OPTION to adjust FOV - There is NO OPTION to even start the game with under 6gb of RAM (the game actually uses only 2gb) So i just payed 119$ for the Hardened Edition of an ALPHA VERSION GAME. Plus additional 80$ for upgrading my RAMs to a level that isn't necessary. There was no open Beta because this f**** game is ALPHA. It would be a Beta if we could discuss things like balancing the multiplayer but you cant even play this game anyway. Nice work for the biggest shooter franchise in gaming history.
