 And while the graphics are improved, the game has some REALLY big problems. It stutters and crashes even on the low. The multiplayer is still the same, while some features are REMOVED! No server browsing. Yeah, big news, there's a character creation. BIG IMPROVEMENT, YEAH. And, also you can't run the game if you don't have the 6GB of RAM minimum. 6GB? REALLY? A BIG stepback from Black Ops 2.
