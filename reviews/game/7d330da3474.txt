 BO2 was my first attempt in the COD series, and I loved every minute of it. Fast forward a year later, and I'm dying to play Ghosts. Due to money and time issues, I chose Ghosts over BF4 and GTA. What a huge mistake. Really disappointing. Mouse sensitivity issues, game crashes, in-game sounds not balanced etc. Last COD i will ever play.
