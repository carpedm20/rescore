50GB game install for graphics worse then Black Ops 2. A 6GB ram minimum requirement when the game uses maybe 1GB(there are mods that let you play the game with less then 6GB of ram). FOV is stuck at 65(you can get a mod that fixes this) - Same damn game as always. Nothing is different here. Campaign is linear and pointless, might as well play MW2 campaign. Thats the reason for the 0. There are games already out there that are infinitely better. Go buy those games(trust me activision dont need your money.)
