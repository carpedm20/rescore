It is the same old story with arcade military shooters which seem to attract mostly the 12 year olds (or people with a brain of a little kid). Military arcade FPS have nothing really new to provide they are made just for "cash cows". Well where from to start the graphics in the game are fortunately clean but surely NOT impressive, the animations in the game look dated with some "cheap" face expressions for a 2013 game.and the funny thing is that the game requires 6.0 GB RAM and 30 GB of Hard disk space while Battlefield 4 has better graphics and less PC requirements (lets not compare it with Crysis 3 graphics and its PC requirements) Single Campaign has some interesting missions and environments fortunately (like fighting in space and underwater) but the whole story experience is full with cliches that we have seen a million times with other COD games it is like watching and starring in some military fantasy B-movie military I have not tried multiplayer yet but seriously i am not that thrilled with this game i have become bored with the COD games
