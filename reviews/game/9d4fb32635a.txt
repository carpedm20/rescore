Modern Warfare 3 plays it safe with the exact SAME thing as MW2. Sometimes I forget that I play a new bestseller since the graphics are the same and the storyline is not that different. If CoD Wants to continue to be a successful game series they NEED something new. It feels silly when compared to next gen graphic games such as BF3 and a lot of other new games. All I can say is SHAPE UP CoD!!!
