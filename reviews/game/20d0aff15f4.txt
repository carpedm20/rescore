Not only do you have to have a constant internet connection to play this game, Ubisoft's servers have to actually be working. If your connection goes down, you lose your progress and cannot play until you restore your connection. So not only does Ubisoft feel that they need to constantly check on you, they also raised the price (I only assume to pay for the servers that don't work).Until Ubisoft learns that this is not how to treat their customers, avoid this game (and others from Ubisoft).
