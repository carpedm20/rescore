6Gb ram minimum requirement, but the engine is still the same, has been using for 14 years, i don't see how much they have improved on Ghosts, the video quality isn't better than previous black ops 2, the physics sucks, this whole 6gb ram joke is ridiculous. Multiplayer lag like hell, 1 second delayed on everything, I can't aim at all, it's like I'm shooting nothing, even though i'm aiming at the enemy. more asia servers are needed. The new extinction mode only got 1 map, easy to get bored, and the whole mode is just like left 4 dead+payday changed to alien theme. Scorpion -an alien that spits corrosive acid, it's a ripoff from l4d's splitter, come on infinity Ward are you serious? are you that lack of creativity? can't believe I paid 60 bucks for this crap.
