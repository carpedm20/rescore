This game is really broken on PC, it's unbelievable that reviewers do not take into account whether developers put in any effort on the version (PC) of the game that they are rating. Bethesda have sadly been extremely lazy on the PC side. I'm not talking about no added bells and whistles, I'm simply talking about basic PC functionality not working. - Numerous graphical issues - Alt-tab causing hangs/crashes (this isn't even hard to fix!) - No borderless windowed mode - No key bindings - Little/no support for non-xbox controllers - Mouse acceleration cannot be disabled Unfortunately this was a double day 1 purchase for myself and my wife so we could play through it this weekend, but it looks like this game is hardly playable in its current state (on our 2 PC's). A friend of ours woke up at silly o' clock to play it and ended up going back to sleep because of what a terrible state it is in. I wouldn't be complaining if this issue was limited to a single machine, but the fact is that this game is very broken on all the machines that ourselves and our friend have tried it on. If you haven't bought this game already, I would recommend not purchasing it until it is fixed.
