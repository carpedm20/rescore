I, like most people were looking forward to playing this game that would be very similar to mw2, After reading the gameinformers I knew this game wouldn't be too different... The campaign had a lot of good in it, but who plays the campaign twenty four seven? As soon as I stepped into the Multiplayer I got discouraged... Every map was terrible, it was like the people who previously made this game died and passed it to their 10 year old children. This game needs completely different maps. Seriously... The maps make the main part of the game, A grotesque, poorly made game.
