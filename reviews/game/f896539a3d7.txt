Super Mario Galaxy is something special. It is filled with adventure, humor, suspense and most of all, enjoyment.On the weekend, I played with my three year old nephew. I controlled direction via the nunchuck and gave him the wiimote.I kinda thought he would get bored very quickly but the little guy was an absolute genius picking the game up! When I wanted him to attack something I yelled "shake it!" and he swiftly took care of all the cutest bad-guys you could possibly imagine! When I yelled "FLY!" he had no problem pressing the "A" button and sending Bee-mario buzzingly up into the sky! He was absolutely enthralled and loving it!This game is class. Perfect for kids and rejuvenating for adults.This holiday season, don't delay - this is the game you MUST play!
