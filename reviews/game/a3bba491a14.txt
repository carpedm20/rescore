I really loved BF3 and was hope for a even better BF4... But so much went bad. And I don't understand why.First graphics: Some how they got worse. Yes I installed the game and the texture pack. But still looks poor.Online: Gameplay is still solid. But no way to get into a game with friends. Its a team based game. You might be able to join a friends game... Most likely on the other team though.Searching through server is broken. You can filter full rooms, empty rooms. But it doesn't work.Single player is short. And thats ok. I bought it for the online.Wanted to like it. But it needs fixing.
