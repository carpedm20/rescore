I don't know how they managed to make the game both play worse and look worse than BF3 but they did.  The textures have trouble loading, the framerate drops and stutters like I am running this on an old PC.  I thought that was one of the things that I wasnt going to have to deal with when I got a console because the game was optimized for it but whatever.The campaign is buggy and terrible which is unfortunate because Omar from the wire is the VA for one of the main dudes(and that char is one of the worst NPC's in recent memory).The multiplayer is way worse than BF3.  Textures load slowly, framerate drops when things start to happen, freezing, rubberbanding, and yeah just not fun.  I loved BF2, 3, BC, BC2 and 1942.  This game sucks compared to them.I set aside 2 whole days for nothing but BF4 and here I am halfway into day one and instead of playing it I am writing a bad review and seeing what my friends are doing.I hate to be the tinfoil hat kind of person but it feels like this game was designed to run on the new consoles and then it was forced to run on the old(360/ps3) consoles after some hamfisted adjustments to textures and stuff.  It just feels so poorly optimized.  I dont know.  What I do know is I regret this purchase.
