The game is beautiful graphically that is for sure.. The sound of the guns are awesome. The problem I have with the game is that in campaign mode I get very bored easily and can only pay for maybe 30 minutes at a time before I just can't stand it anymore...This is the same old same old...just with better graphics.. Once you get tired of ohhhing and awing over the graphics you will get bored quick..... The multiplayer is fun for awhile, but it too is the same thing we have already seen many times and is becoming very stale to me in my opinion. If you are in the middle on what shooter you should buy and your choices are Ghosts or Battlefield 4... Take Battlefield 4, it is a much better game than ghosts, but then again I'm not much of a CoD fan so I might be biased... Truth be told, there is no innovation this time around.. Still a decent shooter..
