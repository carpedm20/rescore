Many of the mistakes from Oblivion makes it into this game as well. * Big empty world * Level scaling which makes leveling up totally pointless. Did they not get the point from the critics after Oblivion? * Inventory in most chests are rubbish. I worked my way through a big dungeon and the end chest contained 6 gold!! That is so pathetic! On the pc, many textures look like they are from a 8 year old game. Skyrim looks VERY dated on the pc. The whole interface is just wrong for a pc game. It's made for console and do not make use of the advantages of a keyboard and mouse. It even installs and starts with a game controller as the default input device. That really says it all I guess :( The only thing Bethesda has put even more effort in since Oblivion is the hype they created for Skyrim. I like the Fallout games, but Skyrim is a sorry excuse for a new age rpg. The more I play this game the more it feels just boring and wrong. Shame on you Bethesda. The game deserve more than 0, but to compensate for all the misplaced high scores that is what it gets from me.
