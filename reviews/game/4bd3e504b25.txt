 Worst game of the year. IGN and others who gave this game such a high score are obviously money hungry idiots who don't care at all about Gaming community. No optimization, bad sounds, 4 HOUR CAMPAING. I think even the campains it's worse than BF4's campaing. Nothing new, just minking the franchise. Again. And again. And again.
