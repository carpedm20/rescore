The Campaign was pretty fun.. But no one cares about the Single Player when talking about CoD.. So lets get straight to the MultiplayerThe Multiplayer has potential to be so good, but failed. The maps are very claustrophobic.  Theres obstacles everywhere, hallways are narrow, and full of so many props you'll find yourself getting stuck on this things more often than not. Another thing is Assassin Pro. When we first heard about Assassin, most people knew that everyone would use it.  Everyone is an understatement.  Slows the game down like crazy, and just makes it boring.  Quick-Scoping is back, and if your competitive and hate quickscopers, don't even bother.. Everyone who uses a sniper, you can almost guarantee will quick-scope, and that hurts your team.. Nobody wants teammates that go 6-34, and not go for the objectives.So to summarize:- Bad Maps- Assassin Pro is overused- Quickscoping is backI suggest you rent it first. Game is fun for about 2 rounds then it gets old...
