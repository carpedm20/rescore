All the kids giving this 1 or 0, pretty sad. How was a game like Battlefield 4 anything more than a same old game? Sure this is the same, yet it is really fun to level "together", to play new maps, try out new weapons etc. And yes, in 3 months I will probably be on to another game, but it will be remembered as fun while it lasted. Just like all the other launches. Beats the Battlefield 4 "vehicles are king" gameplay, with 30% chance to disconnect in the middle of the game.
