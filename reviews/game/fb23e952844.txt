If you like shooters, you will like this game. It has great graphics, for the Wii, and runs fast. The campaign is typical for a COD game.(good but not great) You can still use your mic too. The multiplayer maps in this game are huge. (Bigger than Black OPS) Once you unlock hardcore in multiplayer, thats where the game shines. I think most the reviews are bad because people hate Activision, or any game thats popular. In the end there's nothing innovative but its still a solid and fun game.
