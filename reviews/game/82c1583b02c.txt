Metacritic deleted my previous review! What the hell is that? K, I'll put it in a nutshell: the game which is built on engine of 2007 and requires 6Gb RAM and 50Gb HDD (while console ports with same lame graphics require much less HDD and RAM) is nothing but trash and spit from developers in the CoD fans faces. After total fail of BO2 I thought they will try to do their best and create real game, but instead they started with lying (they promised new engine at the beginning,and than started to backstep) and finished with total trash instead of game. This is ridiculous! Several years ago I gave 10 for MW3, but now I can't give more than 0, as the game and fan's treatment is null!
