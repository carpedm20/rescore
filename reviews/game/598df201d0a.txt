I suppose I'll be the first to write a review that isn't '10/10 GOTY buy now' or 'it's not PC it suxxx'. The campaign storyline is enjoyable and it's a step up from BF3's campaign, though I wish we could stop picking on the Chinese and Russians. I think in several places it manages to out-CoD CoD, which can be either good or bad depending on your perspective. Sadly, there are a LOT of bugs that I've run into, like having guns completely disappear and having to use the dot on my screen to aim, or constant errors and crashing on the Singapore Strait level. For a console game, even a release day console game, this is absolutely unacceptable. Multiplayer I'm still getting the hang of. I'm basing this mainly off my experiences on PC as PSN was down and buggy for much of release day. The unlock systems feel a little awkward, as it's not a clear 'do this get this' progression anymore. As you do stuff with, say, an assault class, you earn points toward unlocking assault stuff, while if you use an assault rifle, you earn points toward new assault rifles, and if you use a particular assault rifle, you get points for attachments for that assault rifle. That means if you're healing or reviving people, you'll get assault score and XP for levels, but not new attachments or guns. There is some randomness involved with battlepacks, which contain paint schemes and unique attachments, and I'm hoping against all hope EA doesn't decide to monetize this (who am I kidding). Graphics on the PS4 are decent enough for 'next gen', but are not anywhere as eyepopping as they are on the PC, and of course, the controls are a bit clunky though the Dualshock 4 is really, really nice compared to the 3. So, bottom line is it's an enjoyable experience HOWEVER the PS4 version has a lot of bugs to work through. If you haven't already bought it with the bundle, I would recommend waiting a month or so for the bugs to get fixed. Once they do, I will revisit my score here.
