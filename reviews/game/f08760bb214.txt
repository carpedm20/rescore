I've played nearly every city-builder game you can imagine over the years, but I'm new to the world of Anno. I have to say that Anno 2070 is hands down the best builder I've ever played. The graphics are stunning, and the ability to build cities underwater is unique and adds an additional level of challenge to the game. Players have the ability to choose which faction they want to follow (basically industrialists, environmentalists or scientists), which makes the game very replayable.The downsides? There is virtually no tutorial, which can make for steep learning curve for beginners, especially if you don't play through the campaign. I frequently found myself searching the internet to figure out how to perform certain actions in the game, and the game manual was very little help. Another downside is the game REQUIRES you to have a Ubisoft account, and it is constantly connected to the internet while you play. While there are some benefits to this, you can't help but get the feeling Big Brother is watching over your shoulder the whole time.Overall, I would say Anno 2070 is an enjoyable game for people who are looking for a high-quality city builder sim to enjoy for a long time. I definitely don't regret my purchase!
