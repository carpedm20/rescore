This is the first Ubisoft PC game I've picked up in a long time and I wish I read Amazon's customer reviews before I purchased. This 1 star review is similar to the others, boiling down to draconian DRM.It's been talked about and debated before, only I would have expected this from a publisher like EA, not Ubisoft:1) 3-time activation limit. Minor hardware changes count toward this limit (also major software changes like OS upgrade). They've only recently (supposedly) removed changing out a graphics card as counting toward the limit.2) Must create a Uplay account. I'm sick of having to create accounts and log into them in order to play single-player titles.3) Support is either very difficult to find or non-existent. Since I know I'm going to reach my hardware limit within the next 6 months due to upgrades, I wanted to have the contact for more activations available... after looking for 15 minutes, I couldn't find any information on this.I'm done with this company.
