 Infinity Ward, 6GB RAM? What? Really? I want to return the spent money because game at me wasn't started at all. I want to cite as an example your main competitor, and so your main competitor is played at me on medium settings 60 fps, and your game isn't started at all! Return my money! Sorry for my bad english.
