Perfection. If there was a bible on game design this game should be on the cover. Perfect controls that make a good use of the unique features of the wii remote. Perfect level design that never felt like backtracking and was always compelling and challenging but without being frustrating nor extremely easy. Perfect art design and the best graphics on the system. Perfect music, orchestrated classic melodies from other Mario games. Best game of a generation.
