I'll start my review off with the good stuff. The campaign is fun.Ok, now to the bad. I'm not a nitpicker, but in doing the campaign it's supposed to be a World War 3 type of feel. Yet, none of the Asian countries are involved? Let me know if I'm mistaken because it seems odd that a country with a billion people some how doesn't end up in a war.Any who, let's get to the heart of the review, the multiplayer aspect.The number one thing you will notice in playing online is the lag. It is so extremely bad at times it makes the game not playable because you don't know what you are doing. Just check this video out [...]. Notice the full four bars. Besides the lag causing choppy unplayable game play, it also causes extreme frustration. For example, I'll be shooting someone but some how I die. Then when I watch the kill cam, it shows me not shooting.The second worse thing about playing online is the respawing. Just check this video out [...]. The game got so horrible due to the lag and respawing players just ended up doing this [...].I can't even review the other things about the game because it's so unplayable. But I will say this, I was told by Gamestop that they are supposed to have a new map every month and I should buy the elite package, needless to say, I have yet to see one. Also, if you are wondering why this game got such high reviews by Gamestop, IGN, etc. it's because they got paid or the fact that they didn't bother to play online when the game was open to the public. So if you like trash then get this game.
