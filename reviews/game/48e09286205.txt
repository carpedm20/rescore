 From PS3 to PS4 - Okay, the graphics for this game on PS4 look amazing, sadly, that's about it. The game is still broken in every way. I get constant lag for no reason, froze in the load screen several times, and I lost my campaign progression, twice. (The second time I didn't really care, the campaign is abysmal anyway. Just skip the entire thing... seriously, don't play it its that bad.) My advise, wait for the game to be fixed first, then buy it when it actually runs properly. In the state it's in right now, don't buy it.
