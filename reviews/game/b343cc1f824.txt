 I bought this game along with my PS4 because the reviews were good. The storyline was ok, but when I went to do online, it was crap. Maps are huge. I don't feel like running 50 miles to find a person to kill. And when I finally got to an opponent, i'd die from a helicopter or tank. Definitely my last BF game i'm buying.
