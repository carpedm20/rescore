This game is abusive to consumer rights. You need a continuous connection to Ubisoft's servers while playing. If the connection breaks, the game stops. And Ubisoft is already having trouble keeping their server online.The pirates cracked this game within 24 hours, so the DRM isn't effective at stopping the pirates. And it's also not effective at allowing paying customers to play, so the DRM fails in every respect. It just ruins the game. If you value your rights as a consumer, don't buy this game.
