The only slightly positive thing about this game is the single player, despite being very short (as usual with CoD). Well written and entertaining. Everything else is unfortunately negative. It requires humongous specs. So I expected HD quality graphics and the IW guys promised quote: 'over 60 fps on all platforms'. Maybe they need to clarify what they mean by 'all platforms'. Because on the PC it jumps between 60-60 to under 20. Often it turns into a slideshow. And now we know PS3 paleyers suffer from framerate stutters too. In general the graphics appear very dated think CoD UO. BLOPS and BLOPS2 look much modern in every way. Only 65 degree field of view? Which cannot be adjusted!!?? WTF Activi$ion?! Do you know is 2013 and most of us use 16:9 widescreen monitors?!! This is a major fail! MP is crazy as always I find the standard MP unplayable the only one that I can cope with is hardcore. But that is a let down too due to very limited number of maps and game types you can use. Customization is minimal I don't really care for it but is worse even than BLOPS 1. The maps I played so far are minuscule the only big map is on standard game type only which I find unplayable to get a kill you need to hit 4-5 times. I will persevere with some of the other new game types, however this is turning to be not just the worst CoD, but just a bad game in general. If you have the game and also have CoD 4 fire that up and check out the MP gameplay. It still beats this hands down.
