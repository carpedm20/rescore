Had a good time playing it, but there was a lot of issues that made the game feel rushed out to meet the console release. One of the big ones was that I could not play conquest. It would just tell me my internet was not working. I could play every other game type though. Also, being a game programmer at a big company, I saw many issues that are easy to fix, that just were not. Connection issues and lag were also an issue, even on my 50mb/s internet. Still have not seen some of the major issues with BF, that have been around since last game, fixed.
