Several problems have already been well documented by other reviews.  I'll add the following two:1. Multiplayer will often join you into a game that is seconds away from ending.  This is a very basic programming bug that they refuse to look into.2. Greed: It's been covered before but the elite membership alienated features and availability from those of us who don't care to pay them more than the standard price of a video game.I'm done with the series, and I hope those reading this will be discouraged enough to pull their support for MW3 and future titles.
