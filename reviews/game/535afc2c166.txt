The multiplayer is a mess.  The latency issues are crippling the gameplay as in it will appear on your end someone shot you with a single bullet and killed you after you fire multiple rounds into them.  Then the killcam will show you standing there not doing a damn thing while the guy who it appeared shot you once and killed you actually put 4 bullets into you before you even aimed.This is a recurring problem from past COD games, except this one it happens literally every match you play, not just occasionally.  When you have to question WTF just happened every single time you lose a gun fight, something is not right.  The maps are all tiny as well.  Small maps are okay as long as they don't rule the entire map selection of a game, like they do here.  The enemy will respawn right behind you a second after you kill them (assuming you do actually kill them and don't get one shot wondered by the horrible latency issues)  I can't recall ever being so disgusted from playing a game online in all my years of gaming.
