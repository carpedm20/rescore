Call of Duty has been a World War II shooter series made by Infinity Ward. Their series have won multiple awards in their 1st and 2nd series. But ever since the 3rd installment released, many have wondered what Infinity Ward would do to change the series.  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a the newest, and hopefully not the last, installment of the COD series. This time the developers have brought a whole new world of military shooters to gamers. This time the game is based on Modern Military combat rather than World War II combat.  The game features Single Player and Multiplayer game modes. The single player campaign is simply amazing. Right off the bat you will realize how amazing the levels look. The story revolves around the S.A.S. Military group and the U.S. Marines. The campaign is no doubt stunning and fun, but sometimes you will find yourself lost and looking for direction. Yes, there is a given compass to "guide" you to your objective, but a black strip with a yellow dot only goes so far. This is a minor problem but it will sometimes cause frustration.  The online multiplayer is great as well. If you are looking for a great online shooter, look no further. The online multiplayer for COD4 brings aspects from the single player together into a fun social package. The online multiplayer features Classes. (Assault, Spec-Ops, Sniper etc.) But perhaps even better than the given classes is the Create-a-Class feature. Where you can specialize in special perks(skills). RPG aspects brought to a shooter is something few companies have done. But COD4 is praised for this.  Call of Duty 4 is Game of the Year material. If you are a fan of military simulation, shooters or just have a Xbox 360, COD4 is a must have game.OVERVIEWPROS- Stunning Visuals- Thrilling- Refreshing style of gameplay- Great MultiplayerCONS- Lack of Direction in some parts
