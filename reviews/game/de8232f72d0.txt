This Near Perfect Game has received a combined critical score from 38 magazines and game sites of 9.8! That score is higher than Halo 3, Gears of War, Call of Duty 4, Assassin's Creed, The Orange Box, BioShock, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, God of War, Resident Evil 4 and as far as I can tell every other game so far!This is as close as a video game has ever come, in my opinion, to something that could actually be considered a real and True work of Art. The orchestrated soundtrack, beautiful, The colors, brilliant, the game, Mind bending Fun! Art is something that either brings enjoyment or changes the way we see and/or feel, perceive, or it does both, and at least for video games this accomplishes both triumphantly. M. C. Escher as well as Walt Disney would be awed by this magnificent creation.This All ages release will bring joy to children and teenagers and make adults feel like children again. It's like a trip to the Magic Kingdom, a ride on a roller coaster, a beautifully animated movie, This game is like other Classic Video Games, like other Classic Mario games, and in the future even after there is another Nintendo people will seek this game out to experience what is sure to become a timeless Classic.Is this the best game ever? Is this the best game of this current generation of consol gaming? Maybe to both but who can really answer such a question because opinions and tastes differ but what 38 professional video game reviewers and I agree on is this is one of the best Must play video games on the market today.If there is any higher praise then this is it, this is worth buying a Wii for and if you already have one then this game should be without question at the top of your buy list.
