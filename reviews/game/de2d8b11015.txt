Worst game of the year.. It's nothing but shiny new large textures over top of the same old predictable gameplay. Single player is the same old corridor game with AI at choke points. Once again it's a respawn parade until you hit imaginary checkpoints. I felt as if I was playing a playable tech demo and not an actual game Activation expects people to pay $60 for. Activation once again succeeds at fleecing the gaming community..
