Hi there, atm the state of the game is just awkward. 1) Impossibile to play Single Player campaign due to a bug with some AMD and Nvdia video cards 2) Graphic is simply AWKWARD and to damn heavy. Srsly i run Bf3 at full settings but this s*** snap in a 10 square meters map??!! I had to set to medium all graphic options and still i have some snap in certain moment, fps drop and so on. 3) 30 and more gb for a game like this?! Nice optimization 4) Paying 60 for "playing" (if you can call it play) a beta. SHAME
