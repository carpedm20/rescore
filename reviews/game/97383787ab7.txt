The single player component features the same outlandish fiction that has been prevalent since MW2. While the presentation was on-par, the game play was uninspired and unoriginal. The multiplayer component would be a rock-solid title if it were not for the incredibly aggressive anti-lag tech being applied to the game. In the COD4/World at War generation, this was easily resolved by dedicated servers which had min and max ping settings and the ability to turn anti-lag OFF. The anti-lag tech produces effects where your actions can be up to 2 seconds behind an opponent, giving you little hope to win in a face to face gun battle. It also impacts general hit registration. Hilariously, some guns are exempt from this. That being said, I can't in good conscience recommend a game that still has this problem after several iterations.
