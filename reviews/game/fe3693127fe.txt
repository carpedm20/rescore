 This game has a lot of promise and does some awesome new stuff. However, EA is still apparently incapable of running servers consistently to meet the needs of their new release. This happens every time a new Battlefield hits, as well as other games like SimCity. At this point, EA has no excuse in regards to their incapability to understand servers.
