I have been playing the Anno games from Sunflower since 1602 was released almost 10 years ago. I was so excited to see this new future version of the game and rushed to buy it, but I'm SO glad I stopped to read the Amazon reviews before purchase.I refuse to buy any software with DRM, no matter how good it is. I'd love to get Heroes 6 too, but I won't buy that either. Thanks for ruining a great game UBI!!
