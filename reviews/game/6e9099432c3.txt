I had very high expectations from this game and so far it has exceeded them.Graphically it's just beautiful, stunning and just plain amazing. Screenshots just don't do justice for the game.In many ways it plays like Mario 64. And don't take that as a bad thing, what I mean is that the game feels very intuitive as to how the mechanics work which makes the learning curve nearly nonexistent.Some of music and sound in the game are a kickback to all of the older Marios that we have all played. What is a Mario game without some Super Mario 3 music?But the main thing for me is how fun and different it is. Even though it seems like you might have already done this or that in another game, it adds a completely different twist to it that makes it more exciting and fun then anything you have ever played.Super Mario Galaxy has completely revolutionized the way you think of a platformer. And at this point the bar has been pushed so high it's galaxies (pun intended) beyond any other platformer I have played or probably will play for years to come.Plain and simple, this is the game to own on the Wii!
