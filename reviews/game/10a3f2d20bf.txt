Yeah yeah It has The Normal and maybe above normal Launch issues But i think giving a good game 0 or 1 of ten is just ridiculous I thought about typing a review after passing the launch issues But no way ] The Game deserves good reviews maybe 6 7 /8 but not 0 Because 0 is for messed up and totaly Glitched Shi*t Anyway The game cores maybe still the same but boy this is cod (Fast paced Entertaining game we all know) The graphics are good if you have The machine Sounds are great maybe better than BF4 Last thing The hate this game gets makes it more good Thats why it over sells anygame (but Bot my Lovely GTAV) Sounds:10/10 Graphics:8.5/10 Gamepla:9/10 (if you are looking for another gameplay mechanics its not here) Multiplayer:10/10 Singeleplayer:8/10 Cuz The story aient that motivationg sometimes(no spoilers) Last Score 8/10
