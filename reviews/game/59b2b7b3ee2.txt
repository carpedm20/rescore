Super Mario Galaxy is a mixed bag. It beats Super Mario Sunshine but still hasn't quite lived up to the same standard that Super Mario 64 set. Sometimes the game is fun and addicting but it also has it's moments of boredom. Graphics: 9/10 Nice visuals and effects Sound: 10/10 Everything sounds 100% Mario Story: 7/10 The princess gets kidnapped for the 3 billionth time. Gameplay: 9/10 Fun with a few bland spots. Overall Score: 9/10 A nice addition to the Wii library.
