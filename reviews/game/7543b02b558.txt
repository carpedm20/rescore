I've had problems with Ubisoft and their DRM in the past and this game is no exception. If you purchase this game, expect problems - lots of them. The DRM has a tendency to harm other things in Windows and only lets you change hardware 3 times. I am not a criminal, but the game thinks I am...I am happy to say Ubisoft will never get another penny from me again.
