Call of Duty is smashing records & making BILLIONS, yet they cant even upgrade the graphics engine COD is making more money then any other game out there, At least change something with all that money,(Like most developers do) hey maybe they could change the leveling up music? CoDs repetitive titles are also taking the eyes of the consumers off of higher standard quality games that deserve it (Skyrim, Skyward Sword, AC:R, BF3, UC3, etc.) It should be those games breaking records, you know, the ones with time actually being spent to increase the greatness of them? the whole damn world bought CoD, they went full retard man.
