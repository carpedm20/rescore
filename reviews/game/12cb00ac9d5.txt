I used to play a lot of CoD as a kid, but got pretty bored of playing the same game after MW2. I got back into it with Black Ops 2, and enjoyed it very much! After Treyarch rekindled my love of CoD, I preordered Ghosts, and I'm glad to say: Its an unplayable piece of trash, so buggy it numbs the mind, nothing new at all, and the new engine actually might look worse than the old one. God damn you Infinity Ward, god damn you! COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE!!
