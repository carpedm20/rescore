 I honestly can't believe people payed $60 (+$50 for premium) for a broken BF3 downgrade. It's essentially a beta that you pay for. In fact, it's more broken that the beta that was released months ago. Freezing and god awful netcode makes this game unplayable. Ignore the critics, this game is awful. Spend your money somewhere else. Perhaps on a game that is finished.
