Ok my first review was a 7 and after 2 hours of gameplay now after about 10 have to drop it to 5, like someone else already mentioned why are my weapons invincible? and why do i regenerate health so quick? fights are already pretty easy , this way you're a demi-god... Lore is nice, but yes have to agree take Morrowind make it a bit more classic fantasy and remove some of the weird interesting stuff (Silt stride -> dude on a cart) After a few hours menus became a bit more easy to use, but they still are console menus, and yes the fights look horrible, especially when you manage to start a "finishing move", which , don't ask me why happens 80% of times, making fights even more easy. A bit of a delusion , was expecting something more, even if i was aware Bethesda is not my kind of RPG game developer.
