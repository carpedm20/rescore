I am a fifty year old Mario fan and this game did not let me down. I have not stopped playing since I purchased two days ago. The graphics are spectacular and Mario is, well, Mario. I was leary of using two seperate controllers, however it actually seems easier. (especially on the thumbs) One word of caution, I tend to get hurt, a lot, and coins are not as abundant as in 64. You must also get used to the walking all the way around the planets on the outside which takes you walking upside down. It's kinda weird at first, but then pretty cool once you get used to it. All in all this, to me, this the best Mario yet. I absolutly love it!!
