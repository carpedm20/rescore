Everyone that worked on Ghosts, especially on the PC Version, should be fired! There is no excuse for such a mess! It looks terrible, it runs terrible (even on high end systems) and most of all it plays terrible. No FoV slider, capped at 90fps, and no way of disabling mouse acceleration. They removed the most interesting game modes (SnD is gone, Headquarters is gone). They increased the weapon damage so that it becomes just a game of who sees whom first. They designed maps that are way to big for a game like CoD and have way too many hiding and camping spots. Ghosts is three steps down from Black Ops 2. People should stop buying those games! Stay far away!
