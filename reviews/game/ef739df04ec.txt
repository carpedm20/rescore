this game must have the worst drm ever! they guy who decided to release a product which such a drm scheme should be removed from working in the software industry instantly.i deeply regret buying this game and having thrown out my money. they did not even warn you before - you just install it three times on different hardware (and I have lots of different hardware) and then you can throw it away.of what use is a game when you cannot use it on any of your machines, when you cannot upgrade your machine anymore, or when you have to be online all the time during play???i will certainly never ever buy a ubi soft product again!
