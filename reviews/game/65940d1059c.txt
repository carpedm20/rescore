I have been playing Battlefield and COD games since they were released.  I love playing both of them and think they both have their merits and drawbacks.  That said, this is the worst game to date.  The multiplayer is the WORST of all of them, just god awful.  I've installed the game to the hard drive and there is still MAJOR lag and it just looks crappy, let alone the gameplay.  I saw how this game had bad reviews on amazon and I still bought it thinking maybe they were just being cry-babies.  Instead I was wrong and have paid the literal price.  Maybe this game was designed for the Xbox One and they tried to push is on the 360 platform and thats why is sucks so bad but I never in my life have played a game this trashy.
