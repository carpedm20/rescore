I'm not sure if the people giving this game a 10 are trolling or just stupid? I'm sorry to say that this is just pretty much the same iteration over and over again. I know graphics isn't as important as say the gameplay in any game, but you would at least expect a much more improved and ground breaking engine? Nope think again, instead we have some slightly improved lighting/water effects oh and lets not forget the revolutionary fish AI and a dog companion how epic! (sarcasm) Single player is a 5 hour long wash out that serves no interesting purpose and is the same familiar type of formula we have seen from previous titles Gameplay is EXACTLY the same in terms of gun mechanics and player mechanics, boring, boring, boring Do yourself a favour, do not buy this game, do not keep falling for the same money milking tricks that Activision keep exploiting and taking advantage of. If you show them that you are tired of the same s**t every single year maybe, just maybe they might change their ways
