The fact is, the game is incomplete. There are numerous gigantic bugs that leave this game near unplayable. EA has released yet another game that should not have been released. So far there are seven major issues. 1. Game stability Crashes all the time for many users triggering error ce-34878-0 2. Save files Files corrupt almost every time an error ce-34878-0 occurs. 3. Network stability Servers frequently kick players from matches often triggering the error ce-34878-0. 4. Game modes Half functioning at best. Obliteration often has server crashes, the main draw for The Battlefield seriesconquest and conquest large do no function at all. 5. Commander mode Has now been disabled, proven to be to buggy. 6. Battle-log Does not update or maintain changes made on computer, phone, or tablet devices; often crashes the game when pulling Battle-log up in game on PS4. 7. MP Stats do not save mot the time due to the frequent kicks from servers. The game should not have been released. I regret paying full price for this, and EA has been quiet on when it will be fixed.
