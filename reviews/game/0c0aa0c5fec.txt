Besides the F2P Battlefield games, Battlefield 4 is the worst game of all the Battlefield games. Let's start with the campaign. The worst AI in any game. There are only 6 levels that take only 10 minutes to complete. So do the calculating and you'll know that the campaign only takes an hour to complete. The most boring experience, too... It's just shooting. You don't get the opportunity to get into a vehicle, besides a boat for only half a minute. Multiplayer. After so many months, still many gamebreaking bugs. Netcode is still a horrible issue, even though DICE said they fixed it/tried to fix it. The game plays horrible because of lag. Also, don't expect any teammates to revive you like they would do in Battlefield 3. That time is over. Nobody revives these days. If these bugs wouldn't be there, this game would've been an 8/10. Now, please, do not buy this game. -A PS4 player who bought BF4 and BF4 Premium... Worst decision ever, unless it's fixed. But it's EA, so don't expect it.
