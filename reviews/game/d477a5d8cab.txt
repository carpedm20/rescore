Lots of great additions in this game such as Commander & integration with phone apps but the stability is shocking! Lots of bugs hamper gameplay too (1-shot kills, spawn trapping and zero spawn-protection). Changing the controls between BF3 & BF4 hasn't enamoured many (I've gotten used to them) but WHY have they changed them again between platforms? (aim/shoot is L1/R1 on PS3 but L2/R2 on PS4 and it's NOT changeable) In 3 months, I'm sure that this game will be great but right now, it's marred.
