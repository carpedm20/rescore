CoD4 is a solid game, I can't see any argument about that.  The game looks beautiful, runs smoothly, and has a very engrossing story.  As much as I have loved the other CoD games, their stories were never as gripping to me as part 4 has been.  The online play is my favorite thus far.  The challenge system allows for continued enjoyment and Prestige mode makes it actually worthwhile to play through many times.  I'm on my second time in Prestige mode and plan to keep going.  I love that all the accomplishements are gained in the campaign mode, so people who don't want to tolerate immature and foul-mouthed children insulting them can actually play and gain the gamer points if they want.But there are two serious issues which have been brought up.  The most glaring is the lack of co-op.  This is truly dissapointing and I can't imagine why this was not included.  It's simply a standard that I am starting to expect in my FPS games.  This is my reason for cutting a star off the rating of an otherwise almost perfect game.The second issue is the length.  It is a bit short.  However, this is remedied in two ways.  First, play the game again on the hardest setting.  Wow, it is a challenge on that setting and it will take you much longer, even if it is a frustating kind of time consuming experience.  And second, play online.  I play multiplayer a lot in this game because I love it.  And in the multiplayer mode, you'll find all the time you could want to spend on this game.In short, a game that is close to flawless.  But the couple of issues it does have do hold it back from achieving the greatness it could have been.  With word out that IW won't be doing CoD5, who knows if they'll have the chance to perfect it in the future?
