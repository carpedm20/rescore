Every negative point I could think of (maybe one or two graphical disappointments) get totally out weight by so many positive aspects! Im basically playing this game now for 9 hours straight... and it actually got released in my territory 9 hours ago. I refuse to believe that anyone who loves the genre would be disappointed with this game. On an entertainment and time per dollar scale this game tops EVERYTHING!
