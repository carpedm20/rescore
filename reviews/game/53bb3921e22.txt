After months of delay from the console release, Ubisoft released the PC version of AC2.$60 is $10 more than the standard pc game price point - so you'd expect some special treatment, right?wrong.This game runs on DX9.  AC1 on PC even ran on DX10. This game requires both you to have a constant internet connection to play single player, and it requires Ubisoft's servers to be functioning.  Unfortunately there have been problems on ubisoft's end has not been upheld, and their consumers are paying the price.If you buy this you are essentially paying $60 for a gimped version of a game that can be had on xbox360 or ps3 for $35.
