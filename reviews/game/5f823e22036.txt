This game is not worth a single penny. Why do people buy this crap every single year? Wake up people, Activision is ripping you off. They say they work two years on this "masterpiece", but isn't it very clear they don't spend more than 6 months? This is just another generic first person shooter. There already way too many of them, and these guys are not helping. This game is not worth your time or money. Buy Call of Duty 4 for 10 bucks instead, it's the same thing. Oh, and be sure to buy it used - Activision don't deserve your precious money.
