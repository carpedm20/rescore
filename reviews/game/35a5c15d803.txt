The game on PS4 simply does not work, and it's not a one-off situation, it's the same for everyone: 1- you can't play the single player campaign as your save games files get corrupted every time. 2- you can't play multiplayer (the reason BF exist...) because either it's impossible to join a server, or you get kicked out, or all other sorts of problems. IE there are no 64 players servers working so far, no Conquest mode, no Commander mode. 3- It will basically get at least a month of patches, if things go well, to get the game to a level of playability even close. Right now, it's just not working for anyone on PS4. Have a look at the Battlelog forums before buying it. Every other game on PS4 works perfectly fine.
