the wii version of the games does a very good job at delivering the MW3 experience from the other versions without losing much in the process.The campaingn mode is the same,it continues the story from MW2 and it also is very short.What will keep you going will be it's Spec ops and Multiplayer modes.The spec ops mode has lost the missions and offline play in it's transition to the wii,but the survival mode is really fun especially in 2 players.The multiplayer is mostly the same only losing a few killstreaks and modes,but the experience is the same and it's really fun,unfortunately the ploblems from it's HD brothers are here as well like akimbo weapons,OP weapons some hackers and campers.But game still is very fun and a good addition for your wii collection,althought i whould recommend black ops
