Here I bought Call of Duty: Ghosts PC thinking this time would be different. Well, it was different because I can not even play the game. The minimum requirements need at least 6GB of RAM and I only have 4GB of RAM on my system. Since when does a game need so much RAM? I will not upgrade my RAM just to play ONE game. So, I got a refund for the game. I hope Infinity Ward fixes this issue so other people don't have to deal with the same problem as I did. This was a terrible thing to do to the players. I can't even give a rating of a 1 because I did not see anything, only an error telling me I can't play the game. It's a shame...Because of this I will not be buying the next Call of Duty title.
