OK, so I bought this game as a last chance for the CoD series to prove itself, I was let down immediately, first if all, a marksman is the same thing as a sniper, so a marksman rifle is the same thing as a sniper, stupid! Also, there still are no dedicated servers and mod tools, even worst, lag comp is still here, also, the game just feels like black ops II and plays like it, the alien mode is truly pathetic, the only thing I liked about Black ops II was the zombies, and these stupid aliens are a complete joke, also, did I mention that this game can play on about 2 gigs of ram? We all saw these ridicolous specs, and what is even more pethetic is that activi$ion andsteam are not allowing you to play it unless you have six, boo! At least there are few decent games this year such as arkham origins and bf4
