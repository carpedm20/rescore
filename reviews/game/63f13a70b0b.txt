It's not a bad game at all, but not worth buying.  It's like deliberately buying a DVD that only works in certain players and skips scenes randomly.  It might be a good movie, but the way they've crippled it make it not worth even a dollar.My advice is to avoid the game.  If you have a 360 or PS3, get that version; they don't have the ridiculous limitations that the PC version has.By the way, Silent Hunter 5 has the same limitations.  Be sure to check out the reviews of any PC game you are thinking of buying, so you can avoid games with this problem.
