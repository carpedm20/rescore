Let me first say that single player is a joke as everyone already knew. The real meat of this game is the multiplayer. On PS4 the game is the best looking shooter EVER for a console. Yes, it looks better than Killzone and plays better. With that said, there are still MANY problems with this game that DICE needs to correct soon. Error screens will pop up and you will lose your saved data. When the game plays correctly it's almost breathtaking. The key is when this happens which is about half the time. Snipers and other long range weapons are fun to mess around with but are almost worthless because the aiming was made for a mouse and not an analog stick. This is why DICE included a partial auto-aim to the console version. This is still a PC title but you will get quite a bit of enjoyment from the console version. BTW, screw EA for forcing DICE to rush this title the way they did. The "finished" product was a beta version and now DICE is having to release patches to fix the problems. EA is a leach to the gaming community. /rant If you're into shooters pick this one up. If not, i'd save my money and wait for what PS4 has in store.
