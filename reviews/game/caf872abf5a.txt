If you do not have an always-on internet connection, stay away from this game.Good game, possibly, but what if Ubisoft's servers go down (they did go down today and people couldn't play)?What if Ubisoft goes bankrupt? They may patch out the DRM like they did in 1404, but then you must search for the patches!Buyer beware. You may not be able to play this when you want to.
