 The main reason why is game is bad is because you can tell that the developers did not care about the game they were making. The Wii did not get MW2 so most Wii players couldn't fully understand the campaign. The multiplayer also had lag shooting then kill streaks didn't work then hackers took over. Overall all its an awful game.
