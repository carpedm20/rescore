I usually am wary of any changes in leveling or combat made to series I love, such as the drastic changes between Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. But in this case, I think Bethesda knocked it out of the park. The borrowed some things from their Fallout games, such as the lockpicking minigame, which is vast improvement over Oblivion's minigame.The combat system is great. You can dual wield blades, dual wield spells, go one of each, go sword and shield, or any other combination you can think of. It is somewhat annoying to have to go to the menu and change your spells frequently as you can only have at most 2 active at a time, but as combat can be paused at anytime, it is not that big of a deal.The leveling system has been completely revamped, while keeping the core concept of you are what you play. No more overarching attributes, only your skills, which go up as you use them. Because they got rid of the attributes, the annoying griding to get a +5 bonus on 2 or 3 attributes from oblivion is gone. You just get to play your character however you want. In my opinion, Skyrim is superior to Oblivion in everyway. If you love RPGs, get this game!
