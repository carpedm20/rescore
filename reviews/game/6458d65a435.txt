Fallout 3 with dragons and swords. This is what this game is. I simply cannot understand the hype around this game. Level designers worked their asses off, because everything in the game is detailed, and each zone, and each house have a story to tell. But graphics are horrible. Everything has that bland, monochrome Fallout 3 look. Facial animations look like something from 2005, and the entire game feels like it was built on some game engine from the same era, that Bethesda continuously iterated upon until Skyrim. (Oh, wait, that actually happened. Bethesda could have learned something from Valve's Source engine, because that's what good iteration looks like.) The facial animations are so bad and ugly that, at times, I can't even understand what character is actually speaking. Voice acting is terrible, I was expecting much more from Skyrim. The UI is nothing to write home about. All these shortcomings, yet people rave about this game like it's the second coming of baby Jesus. What is this world coming to?
