For starters, my brothers and I snagged the midnight release at our local Gamestop and didn't stop playing until rays of light crept through the windows. Over hyping expectations can be a dangerous thing for any game, but this new installation to the Elder Scrolls series is simply a gem.  The game is visually impressive, mechanically sound, and increasingly more interesting with each step in the plot. With one massive, dragon filled main quest, four sizable guild based quest lines, two warring factions to decide from, and hundreds of smaller quests to under take, there is almost too many things to do in the vast, snowy land of Skyrim. I found myself constantly side-tracked, trekking off the beaten path to discover a cave or a shrine, looking for a nice piece of loot or a new quest to conquer.  55+ hours in and I feel that i've still got so much to accomplish. Even though there are a few small problems here and there, these tiny hick-ups do nothing to take away from the overall experience. If I wasnt going to my Uncle's wedding tommorow, I would be slaying trolls and slinging spells all night long.  Go to the store, pick up the game, and prepare to enjoy the game. At the midnight release, my brother joked that they should just give everyone the "Game of the Year" edition. After experiencing the Skyrim in its totality, I think he was on to something.  Get the game, play it, see for yourself.
