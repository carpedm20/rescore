Battlefield 3 was amazing, the second best shooter of this generation behind CoD4.  However Bf4 is a buggy disaster, and isn't worth playing even if you were given a copy for free.  I'm not going to go into the dozens of gamebreaking problems, just scroll down and look at other reviews.  I made the mistake of buying this because of Bf3, and my grievous error was buying the season pass for a game so broken they've interrupted all DLC plans while attempting to fix the base game.  This has to be the first game franchise I've ever seen where from one version to the next they went from a 10 to a 1.  Great job EA & DICE, you've lost someone who would have been a Bf customer for life.
