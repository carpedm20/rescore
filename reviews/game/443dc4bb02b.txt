you come home from work everyday and play it just as much as you did when it came out over a year ago....I love this game.  Its addictive, the graphics are insane, the story mode is excellent, and multiplayer is incredible.  When you die in MP, you know its because of what you did/didnt do. This isnt Halo where you can 'nade someone, empty a clip into them, and then they turn around and 1 shot you.  You kill, its because you were better.  You die, its because you weren't.....Absolutely incredible game and worth every penny.....
