This game is Broken, Unplayable, and an insult to customers. Looks great for the 5 minutes you can run it. I have had it since release day, and the one servers side patch they put out broke the game even worse. I love the series, and would love the game if it worked, but being told on day 2 that you have to wait for a week to get a patch that MIGHT fix it is deplorable. They knew it was broken before they released it, as the other platforms it was released on earlier are also busted. No other industry gets away with continuously putting out broken products.
