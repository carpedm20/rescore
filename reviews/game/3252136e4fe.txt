Well, this is in awesome city-builder for fans of games that require you to juggle tons of resources, like Caesar III and the like. Unfortunately, the game is unusable without internet and is very limited in the number of activations you get. Having a frequently upgraded gaming PC and a laptop results in lots of changes. Having to call up support is annoying, and is a stop-gap solution to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place. I am seriously considering grabbing a pirated copy even though I own the game just so I don't have to put up with Ubisoft's ignorant attempts at defeating piracy.
