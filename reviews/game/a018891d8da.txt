The graphics are from 2011, that's okey, but... the requeriments... i have a GTX 480 and in maximum settings i have "60" frames, with drops to 20fps and 1fps. 70GB, yep.. 70GB for graphics from 2011 (Have textures that looks the same in Black Ops II and Black Ops II are only 20GB) The history pfff.... i don't want to talk about that. The Extinction mode is fine, is funny. Ah, and we don't have quickscope anymore (And we can't do ALT+TAB)
