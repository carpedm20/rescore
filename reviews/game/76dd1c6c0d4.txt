I have been playing the cod series since big red one. I have owned all of them excluding the original. I loved cod 4 W@W even mw2 was alright until the hackers got a hold of it, I loved Blops. But I hate this game, The map designs are terrible its very easy to trap people in their spawns. After playing cod for so many years I am use to their maps design and can sort of feel my way around a map I have never played before, just from my past experiences but not in this game. The maps are very small and full of tiny building and debris to hide behind. Guns like the ump and the dual fg are over powered combine that with the small maps there really isn't a reason to use any other guns. The spawns are worse than the unpatched spawn from blops. For those of you who purchase blops last year you probably remember how bad the spawns were before they were patched, but this takes the cake I have literary spawned on top of a enemy almost every game. Getting spawned killed happens all the time.  The single player is alright I enjoyed it, the one thing that cod developers do right on all the games is the single player. Its action packed and fun for a play though. After playing the single player I imagine this will be the last Modern Warfare game. What will be next IDK but the story pretty much ends here. Spec ops is fun but does not hold my attention like nazi zombies did. If your looking to buy this game I suggest not and to stick with blops. Their are a ton of other games out there right now that are better. Gears 3, skyrim, bf3.
