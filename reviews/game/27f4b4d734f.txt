Good grief. I can't believe I fell for it again. I heard dedicated servers, next gen visuals, "new" feel to the movement and weapons, and a redesigned class system. I got excited. Then I saw the host migration screen. Then I saw that my fov was stuck at 65 and Infinity Ward are doing their best to keep fixes from being made available to the public. Then I saw the rubber banding when I was 10 ft around cover and suddenly die. Then I realized that secondary weapons are pointless unless you're out of ammo in your primary because you die so ridiculously fast in this game that weapon switching during a firefight just means you're already dead. It's just like any of the other modern warfare series of games. Treyarch really stepped up with blops 1 and then again with blops 2. And yet these idiots at Infinity Ward just screw it all up and take 10 steps back from what Treyarch was doing with PC CoD. I'm so disappointed after only 3 hours of playing I have no desire to pick this game up again. Everything that was good about Infinity Ward is now over at Respawn making Titanfall anyways. Maybe they will blow CoD away and people will look back and remember this series that took advantage of so many players. How they promised the world and barely gave us anything when it came time to deliver. CoD is officially a two year title for me from now on as long as Infinity Ward keeps bring this crap in the off season. I'll support Treyarch as long as they continue to do what they promise.
