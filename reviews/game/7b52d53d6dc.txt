Though it doesn't say anywhere in the description, you *NEED* an internet connection to play the game. Yes, you need to be connected to an Ubisoft server *at all times* in order to be able to play. No playing out in the backyard, or on the beach, or while waiting for your bus... Without internet, no game!And so far the Ubisoft servers have done nothing but crash, be unavailable, break off your game-play, lose your saves and so on. Officially, it's all because of attacks on the servers... yeah, right. And irate customers who are trying to vent their frustration on the Ubisoft forums are having their posts deleted.I'm paying for an *offline* game, not for an online one (I have enough of those). I sent mine back.
