As just about every other review has stated so far, beware when purchasing this game. It's single player only but you can be locked out from playing it if you don't have an internet connection that's 100% up while playing, and as long as UbiSoft's servers are online (which they aren't always).If you absolutely must play this game, play it on a console. Avoid the PC version. You will be at the mercy of a draconian DRM system that is completely out of your control to play a game that has no online component apart from Ubisoft keeping an eye on you like a criminal.This is no way to run a business and my pocket will speak for me. AC2 & the new Splinter Cell were two games I was going to purchase from Ubisoft... not going to happen anymore. I rather support developers/publishers that don't treat their user base like thieves.
