 So here's an idea for a game guys. You have a gun, and you can shoot people. Sounds good right? Wrong. After several iterations of the same damn thing, Infinity Ward have finally topped it off by letting you play as a woman in order to appease the neo-feminists of America and their love for dogs. However the game is still boring and awful and I wish they'd stop making this stuff.
