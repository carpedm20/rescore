From what little I actually was able to play, the game itself was enjoyable, but I cannot give a favorable review to a product which I could not use.  Due to computer hardware problems/upgrades, I changed my 'configuration' four times in a very short time window.  Each time I had to 're-register' and finally the company refused access.  Their support was not helpful.  It is a fun futuristic-Civilization-like game, but the DRM scheme punishes the player.  Additionally you need Internet access to play; doesn't work offline.I'm afraid I will not spend anymore money on products from this company; I feel very ripped off.  I did not purchase from Amazon, so I cannot comment on how their own customer service would handle my circumstances.  Writing this just to warn other people away.Do not buy this game if you are planning on upgrading your computer or trying out different video cards in the near future.Update:  According to a link in my comments the company has removed the graphics/video card from their DRM hardware hashtable, meaning you can swap out video cards now.  Apparently they have had such a backlash (my case is apparently not unique) that customer service is allowing additional activations to combat the bad publicity on a call-in basis.  (Wish that happened when they were rude to me earlier.)  Three item limit remains for other hardware.  Personally, I already deleted the game from my system before writing this review, so it's too late for me.  My experience has been frustrating and stressful.  While ANNO 2070 might deserve another chance, I do not feel like devoting more of my precious leisure time to Ubisoft products.  Slightly regretful I'm missing out on a good game, but one star stands because Ubisoft failed.
