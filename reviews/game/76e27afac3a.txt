Because my son begged for Anno 2070 so much, I purchased it on DVD even though I had read the negative reviews.  After one day of playing, he wasn't able to log on any longer.  After sending numerous emails asking for help, Ubisoft merely sent links that "might" help and also said that they were unable to send user names/passwords via email because of security measures.  Having to call them long distance in England is absolutely ridiculous after just spending $50 for this game.  Never again!  Ubisoft's customer service leaves a lot to be desired!
