This is basically MW3 with triple the system requirements and half the framerate. I guess that's what counts as "next gen" for Activision and IW. The campaign is as bad as always and multiplayer is the same, only choppier. Nobody involved in the making of this gave a fk, that much is clear. Just go through the list, tick the same feature boxes, package, sell to dudebros, rinse and repeat. There are many good games coming out this holiday season, so I see no reason why you should buy this. BF4 is buggy, but if they patch it up a bit it's definitely more impressive. AC4 has also been milked to death, but at least you play it and you see some effort, they tried to make a great game, they mostly succeeded and it's worth the time you spend on it. This isn't.
