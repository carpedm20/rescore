Let me add to the parade. Screw you Activision, Inifinity Ward, and Treyarch. Money grubbing thieves. I can't believe you would even consider this for release. I am pretty sure this game was ported over to PC and hour before launch. Not to mention, this is the most poorly optimized piece of trash I have ever played, besides Ride to Hell: Retribution. But anyway, thanks for stealing my money and giving me nothing in return.
