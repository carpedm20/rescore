I have always loved the Call of Duty series but as of late it has been given the same treatment as the Madden series (IE they add TINY features each year and ask you to pay 60$ for a """new""" game).  But this latest installment has crossed the line.  Most of the fanboys constantly ask well WHY do you not like this game?  (Valid question and i shall go through that in multiple points)1. The maps are the smallest in ANY Call of duty game to the point your nearly always spawning right on top of someone.2. The graphics engine is the exact same as MW2 regardless of what any fanboy tries to tell you.  This may have been ok if this game was released a year after MW2 but not now.3. Already new Wall glitches in the game and similar problems MW2 was plagued with (Youtube and see it for yourself).4. P2P servers....again....in 2011?  REALLY?  Why on earth would you use P2P servers which are Laggy,Slow,Disconnect often,Easily hackable when most other major IP's use Dedicated servers.....Activision will make 3-4X more money then EA will see from BF3 and even they put dedicated servers into BF3.5.  The Campaign is Short/easy and Extremely predictable....a rather large disappointment for a direct sequel.6.  Rampant Killstreaks What i mean by this is since the maps are so insanely small you can rackup killstreaks way way easier then in previous CoD titles.  So you see 3-4X more killstreaks then in previous versions.7.  The leaderboards have ALREADY been hacked again....(Look at the leaderboards see for yourself)8.  The hit detection....is the worst i have seen in any shooter since...hell ever?9.  No Marathon perk (Opinion)10.  EVERY gun is insanely overpowered, literally even the SMG's kill in 2-3 Shots at medium distance.  Combine that with small maps and it becomes a Camp fest of who runs around corner A first.All in All this is the biggest disappointment in the series in my mind...Save yourself the 60$ and take a woman out to dinner.
