So I was watching, playing the demo, and someone else's copy.  I honestly fell in love with this game and ready to drop my money on it, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't like to spend much money on games.  The thing that stop me is the amount of bugs that I've been through, campaign trigger bugs and what not.  Sure, I'll probably need to get full version and update to get it working.  What really stop me is the DRM reviews online.  I honestly don't feel like I would have a real ownership of the game.  Ubisoft, DRM doesn't stop piracy, it stop customers to purchase your game.  I honestly want to play with people online.  But now, forget it.  I thought only EA blew it, but I guess you too.  Thanks Ubisoft, unless you change your policy, I'll never drop a bug on DRM games ever.
