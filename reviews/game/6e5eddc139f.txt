By far, one of the best FPS ever made. Single player missions are insanely realistic with the best AI I've seen in a video game yet. It gets your heart pumping. Online play is out of this world. Has a ranking system where you get better weapons and skills are you score more points in online play. The online play is worth the $60 alone. This is a must have game.
