It's a single player game that requires an internet connection.  Just to be clear, there is no cooperative mode, there is no head-to-head mode, no team games.  This game is for one player and one player only, and yet it requires an internet connection at all times.  Internet goes down?  Too bad.  Ubi's servers go down?  Too bad.  Ubi decides in a year they don't want to support the game anymore?  Too bad.  Feel like your privacy is violated by this mysterious connection transferring who knows what data in the background?  Too bad.  You can buy the disc, but that's not enough, you still have to rely on the good graces of the company for that $60 purchase to actually do anything.  Buyer beware.
