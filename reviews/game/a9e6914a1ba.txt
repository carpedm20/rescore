 You know the game's pure when one of the in-game cutscenes is ripped from the MW2. No, it's not called an hommage; it's laziness of the programmers and the cutscene director (or whatnot), that are hoping that no players would remember that cutscene. Well, guess what? I've played all CoD games, since the very first one, and to the MW3. Won't happent to repeat that mistake anymore.
