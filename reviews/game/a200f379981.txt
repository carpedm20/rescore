I realize this is one of the greatest games on the market, hands down.  The single player campaign is simply crazy.  But on multiplayer it doesn't even come close to a game like Rainbow Six Vegas.  I've spent hours with my serious gamers playing those maps over and over, but with this game, I'm done after I beat it on single player campaign.  That was the feeling for most of the people I played with online. Co-Op would have made this the perfect game.
