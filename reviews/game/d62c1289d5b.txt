I have always loved the Call of Duty series, and this one lives up to the legacy.  This game is nothing short of amazing.The first thing you notice is how gorgeous this game is.  The graphics are amazing and really give a feel for being there.  There is no feel of shift form in-game video and cut scenes like some other titles.  From open fields and Russian mountains to tight alleys in Baghdad, everything has a real feel to it.  Lighting, character models, animations, terrain, nothing is left behind as far as quality goes.  While the graphics are amazing, one map stands above the rest.  The Sniper map near the middle of the single player campaign is breathtaking.  It is shocking how good that level looks, there are times I stop just so I can look around.  The lighting in particular stands out on that level.The voice work is also well done.  There is none of the awkward, third rate soap acting that we have come to expect from most titles.  For once, the voice acting actually adds to the title, instead of detracting from it.Story for first person shooters aren't always the best, and while the one in this COD4 is good for a FPS story-line, it isn't particularly great.  It is about what could be expected, and many stereotypes are played upon.  There is a high point.  The ability to play through the death of a character, is amazing.  There isn't any action in the scene, and the characters already a gonner.  But to be able to crawl out of the downed chopper and into the nuclear blast ravaged country-side before dying is priceless and a great innovation.  The one real problem the game has is in the story telling, specifically the ending.  It feels very abrupt, and makes me wish there was more of a transition.  The end practically sneaks up on you.This is one of the all time best FPS.  Everyone should play this game.
