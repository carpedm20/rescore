It could be technically the same game as its predecesors, but the graphics have been polished, pushing the wii limitations to a great level (not as good as Conduit though)... The customisable gameplay is still awesome, and shooting with the wiimote feels more natural than ever. The lack of split screen multiplayer is still kinda disapointing, but the online multiplayer is one of the best online experiences you can found on wii (make sure to have a great wi-fi connection)... The Spec Ops can be played online or alone, which is very addictive and increase the replay value of the game.... The game may suffer of some lag and frame rate issues but nothing that could annoy you at all!... Definetly as worth as his bigger HD brothers!!!
