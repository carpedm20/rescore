I don't know why this game is so loved it just an overrated piece of crap. Sure the game looks nice I wish I could say the same for the gameplay its so broken. I find my self slipping off platforms and also falling through them. Sometimes I don't know where to go or I find out to late and I'm dead. The gameplay is as repetitive as ever. This was supposed to be the true worthy successor to Mario 64. Ha this game isn't worthy enough to be the sequel to Hotel Mario.
