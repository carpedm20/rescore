chlbrn Nov 5, 2013 0 Pre purchased this game days ago. Pre load this game 3 days ago. Different regions have different unlocking time which is unfair. People in Russia and France can play it about 15 hours earlier than people in Canada. If you pre load both MP and SP, when you click play button after unlock, it will unpack SP files but also instantly wipe out all MP files which contains shared file which means you still cannot play SP. Damn, We have to re down load another 24GB files for over 10 hours. This is one of the fatal flaws. If we have to re download files, what is the difference to have a damn pre load option? to tease you before you can play or to mock you after you cannot play and feel angry? Shame on them. Another fatal flaw is 6GB damn ram requirement. I have 24GB ram and I have no issue with it at this point. But I know many people's pc still has 4 GB ram and 4 GB for playing games at low or med settings is totally enough. According to my experience with 3D software and after effects software and games, only a long image rendering queue uses over 4GB ram which can take over 16GB ram. But not a single game. It is simple. And from reports, ghosts doesn't need 6GB to run, it only uses 2GB so 4GB is good to go. I know it is good for people to warn them that their system might not be good to handle a game. But polite notice or warning is good, simply blocking people from playing it is bad, I am serious, really bad.
