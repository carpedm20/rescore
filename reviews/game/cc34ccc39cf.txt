Please, don't get this game. Firstly, I am reviewing the PC VERSION and technical issues. The game itself is absolutely amazing and beautiful, so don't worry about that. The problem (for PC users) is the DRM. If you haven't heard of it, you will soon if you're wondering why this game has such low stars.I don't mind connecting to the internet once to activate my game, albeit annoying. But this is horrid. You have to connect to the internet at ALL TIMES. Logical for multilayer, but for a single player? What was Ubisoft thinking?I understand the issues of piracy, and I don't blame the company for seeking ways to stop it. However, this is not to way to go. If anything, this makes people want to go pirate even more--for a version that isn't tied up with all of these restrictions, not to mention the odd $10 hike.Overpriced, infected with fine print, and fun is destroyed by the DRM--Please do not waste your money. I am very sad, because this game is truly a masterpiece, but Ubisoft has fallen to the low like many other companies, and are just wanting to make money--that, and I really think they do this for fun, just to annoy us. It hurts my feelings how Ubisoft just walks all over the toes of loyal PC gamers and treat us like trash.Just boycott this game, or go buy the 360 or PS3 version.Next time, Ubisoft, please work with your fans to solve the problem. Thank you.
