I'm a long time Mario fan all the way from Super Mario Bros (NES) to Mario 64. This game just doesn't cut it. 1) It's really easy. I beat the third bowser in about ten hours or so and hardly ever died. 2) It's really repetitive; nearly the entire game focuses on the gravity based physics of jumping from planet to planet. Maybe it's more fun if you play while dropping acid? 3) Since when does Mario get a story? This game seems to be designed for small children... a huge letdown for older fans
