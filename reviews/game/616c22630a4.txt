I had to stop playing the excellent campaign after a couple of hours due to becoming very nauseus by the "horse blinker" view they've artificially imposed on us PC players. After a few days I finally found a hack to allow me to change FOV to a totally playable 100 instead of 65. The only reason Infinity Ward did this is because they put the PS3 and Xbox 360 version above all else and since these crappy old consoles can't handle the graphics they have to lower the FOV. That's well and good but if they allow higher FOV on PC the screen shots will look too good side by side with console versions and the fanbois won't be happy to shell out for a copy on PS or Xbox and will just blame them for not optimizing it enough. Well screw you! My 3570K with 8GB RAM and HD7870 is waaaayyyy more powerful than that and doesn't even break a sweat on highest graphic settings with 100 FOV. Why should I be limited?? At least BF4, with its less than entertaining single player has a FOV slider all the way to 120 degrees. And kick ass graphics on PC!
