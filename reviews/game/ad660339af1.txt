I was one of the Lucky ones to be part of the beta of this game. Ever since then I was totally addicted to the realism of this game. In this game you don't "get owned" as in halo. You always have a chance to have a good game because of all the options that make each player unique. Combining the right perks with the right weapons will be the key to this game. The graphics are just JAW DROPPING! The frame rate is FLAWLESS! You will not feel dizzy after playing this game, guaranteed! Most importantly this game is PURE FUN! Easy to pick up and just play without any previous experience. This is a MUST HAVE for Xbox 360 0wners!!! I promise YOU!
