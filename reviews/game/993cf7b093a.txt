I'd like to point out that nearly all of the negative user reviews are PS3/360 players that have never played it on Wii. They say that it's "identical to MW2", even though Wii didn't even get Modern Warfare 2. But anyway, about the game. This is a great game with the best online multiplayer on Wii. The graphics are a lot better than Black Ops Wii and there is barely any lag. I haven't played much of the campaign, but Survival Mode and Multiplayer are really great. While the online infrastructure is basically the same as Black Ops, it works better than any other Wii game. I have a few problems with it though. It doesn't have split-screen multiplayer and voice chat doesn't always work well. Sometimes the game lags, but I find that there is less lag now, a few months after release. Another slight problem is that the Wii version doesn't have the Spec Ops missions and some of the kill streaks. I know that the Wii isn't powerful enough to run some of the kill streaks, but hackers have found that Predator Missiles are actually hidden in the games code. Overall, this is a great game for all FPS fans and definitely worth a buy!
