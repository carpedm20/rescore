I don't know how stupid game rating critics like ign,gamespot,machinima and etc... Gives so high rating. This game is completely step back from bo2, i know bo2 wasn't perfect... Anyway infinity ward puts activision into the shame the only hope is treyarch. Since mw2 I'm not super fan of cod, i reply enjoyed all series until mw2, bo and bo2 is not bad but mw3 and ghost is really shame. No more cod going back into battlefield 3and 4
