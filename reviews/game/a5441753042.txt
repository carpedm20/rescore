I made an account just to post here about this so that no more people fall into this trap. This was my first entry into IW take on CoD after loving CoD:blOp and blOp2...Ghosts is atrocious mess by comparison, utter waste of money, sound frequently drops out or gets choppy, Multiplayer looks horrible and is close to unplayable. The visuals are non existent, if this is what you call next gen then I'll sit this one out or any future entries of CoD for that matter. Genuinely feel like asking for a refund. Sad
