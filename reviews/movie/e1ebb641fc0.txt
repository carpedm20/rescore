I have to admit that ive spent waaaay too much time with my buddies and bros after Reloaded trying to guess what this movie would hold....man, were we off!!! (although I did dig my theory that Neo could lock into the Matrix wirelessly, kinda like WI-FI) I will also admit I was a bit worried whether the brothers could wrap this up in two hours, and yet leave us with enough eye candy.....WELL THEY DID IT....im so impressed with this movie on so many levels....As far as my take, It has to be when the Oracle tells Neo that he and Agent Smith are one and the same, exact opposites of each other.  I think that the reason Agent Smith dies at the end is because in order to keep the balance of both of their existence, Neo's sacrifice of himself to save the people (no need to tell you about the religious undertones here) ultimatley kills Agent Smith as well, because Neo's existence had to balance out Agent Smiths existence.  (Im gonna have to watch this again...and again, and again)The War scence in Zion was magnificent...and had the whole theater cheering at its close(I remember the frustration I felt was so real when the second wave of machines made theyre way through...not to mention the end fight scene between Agent Smith and Neo was absolutely brilliant...There are many religious undertones to the conclusion of this movie, mainly dealing with faith(Oracle's belief in Neo,christianity/judaism/islam (Ressurection of Neo and his sacrifice for his people) and even some Hinduism (the belief of reincarnation, much like the recreation of the Matrix six times) and lets throw some good old Kharma into the mix for good measure.Absolutely fantastic.
