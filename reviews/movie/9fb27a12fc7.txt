A truly dismal movie, The Matrix Revolutions fails on all fronts, except maybe computer processor time used for the CGI.  The Matrix was an excellent sci-fi movie, and the disappointing mess of The Matrix Reloaded at least hinted at something cool happening in Part 3.  Well, we've got Part 3, and it stinks.The acting has gotten progressively worse, the effects vary from awe-inspiring to lamer than old Star Trek movies, the story just kind of fizzles out like a bad beer fart, and all the potential plot twist coolness hinted at in The Matrix Reloaded is fortotten about in favor of a straightforward and numbingly dumb ending.This is a bad ending to a series that should have never been made beyond the first film.  It is now clear in retrospect that the W brothers really had no clue what to do after cooking up The Matrix, and so just threw together some expensive crap and tied it together with CGI just to turn a buck at our expense.  The Matrix Reloaded and especially The Matrix Revolutions embody all the worst things about Hollywood movies: pointless sequels that replace the original sharp plotting with "special" effects and loud audio.
