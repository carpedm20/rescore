Make no mistake: the plot and writing in this movie are subpar at best, and everybody involved with the movie obviously realized that their script was corny and their plot was paper-thin. But it just doesn't matter. The concept is solid as a rock, the pacing is wonderfully built, and del Toro does a masterful job with withholding and revealing information at the perfect times for maximum effect. The result is a well-crafted, $200 million on-screen embodiment of the movie your 10-year-old self dreamed of seeing someday. Pacific Rim knows exactly what it is: two hours and ten minutes of totally bad ass fun.
