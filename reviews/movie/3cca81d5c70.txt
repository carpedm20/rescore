The movie's special effects ALONE are worth the money. Then you got the great story, the mysteries about the monsters and you always feel like O.O THESE GUYS GONNA DAI! And half the time they do... Oh also there's Hellboy. Although the movie was great in terms of story AND special effects, the humor is just not satisfying enough, and you never really care for the characters other than the main ones. So for that, this GREAT movie gets an 8.1
