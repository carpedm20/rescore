An improvement on Reloaded at the very least, but it just carries on far too long and has a rather pathetic ending. Honestly, it should have ended after Agent Smith's defeat and left off on an epic note. Unfortunately it goes on trying to portray Neo as a new age Messiah with a rather convenient a "all-things-wrapped-up-in-a-neat-bow" expositional ending. Overall: An OK movie with a bit of a let down of an ending. Some grade A fight scenes however. Anyone else think the final battle between Neo & Smith looked like it came straight out of Dragon Ball Z?
