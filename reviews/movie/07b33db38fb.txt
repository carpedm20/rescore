A spectacular tour de force of visuals and characters both larger than life and inspiring. It would be easy to get lost in the sheer gobsmacking action; however, charismatic and emotional performances by most of the cast propel this action thriller beyond the orbit of what we've come to expect from FX driven titles. Not for the faint of heart, Pacific Rim will reward you with powerful imagination and a heart of its own.
