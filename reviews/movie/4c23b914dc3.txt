 Pretty much everything i could ever want out of a giant monster movie. The only downside is that every time someone who isn't Idris Elba had some lines, it distracted my attention a little from Idris Elba being named Stacker Pentecost. Sorry, i just need to say that name again: Stacker Pentecost. Stacker Pentecost. I lied. Stacker Pentecost.
