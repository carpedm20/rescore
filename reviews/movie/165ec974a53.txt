LMS is a very "interesting" movie--not necessarily "good" in the conventional sense but interesting.  It's more subtle and sophisticated than people seem to give it credit for.  It's funny but I wouldn't call it a comedy; it's has plenty of angst and failure but I wouldn't call it a tragedy (or melodrama, or whatever).Each character is dysfunctional but not to such a degree as to be unbelievable (a la "Running with Scissors").  They each have their own personal conflict to overcome but they are each defeated by it (except the little girl).  Even though the characters all fail, they do still emerge stronger and more unified as a family because of it.  (It just occurred to me--one of the characters is always reading Nietzsche, who popularized the quote "that which does not kill me makes me stronger.")LMS is not a "comedy" (although often funny--ESPECIALLY the ending); it's not a National Lampoon roadtrip movie; it's not "glorifying dysfunction" (as another reviewer posted); it's not a social commentary about the exploitive and pseudo-sexual industry of child beauty pageants.  IMHO it's much more existential than that.This, combined with a great cast makes for a very interesting movie.  People who pay money for explosions, slap-stick, big breasts, and car chases will hate this movie.  If you're not the unthinking drone that Hollywood assumes most (all) of us to be, then LMS is defiantly worth your time.
