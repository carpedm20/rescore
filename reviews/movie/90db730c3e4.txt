 Great, masterful work, would have given it 10 but Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler and the awful Cate Blanchett have way too much cheese in their acting, other than that, an epic adventure, and one of the best fantasy movies of our time. Funny though, George RR Martins 'Game of Thrones', is a far better book and far better on screen...
