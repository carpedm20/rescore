 Return of the King is probably my least favorite in the trilogy, but that doesn't make it in any way a bad movie. The battle scenes are awesome, but they get a bit repetitive after a while. Also, this one was a bit harder to follow than the other two. Other than that though, this is a great conclusion to one the best movie franchises of all time!
