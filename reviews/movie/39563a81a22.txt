I see a lot of reviewers were offended or upset by the stereotypes, but they fail to realize that the film was spoofing those stereotypes. If we can't sit back and laugh at ourselves sometimes, we'll never get by in this world. You need to calm down and have a positive outlook (see my reviews of Wally Amos and Arrested Development!)This movie wasn't meant to be "Citizen Kane" or even "Watermelon Man". It is just light and funny (sometimes VERY funny) escapist fun.Sure, the humor is raunchy (especially this unrated version), but the laughs keep coming, and that's what matters to me.Tom Arnold keeps proving himself to be a pretty funny guy now that he stepped out of Rosie O'Donnell's shadow.Snoop Dogg, whose music I really don't care for, has a screen presence that surprised me. He'll surprise you too!And you gotta admit, the concept of this film- an airline owned and run by Africans in America- is just brilliant. I wish it would really happen, though I guarantee the airline would be better run than the one depicted here.
