This film was a massive disapointment.  I loved the first Matrix, it's one of my top five favorite flicks. The second...eh.  The end had a few cool action scenes.  What did this film bring to the table, you ask?  Some neat special effects.  That's about it.  The final battle scene involves a few ancillary characters introduced with minor roles in the second movie.  That's right, none of the original three characters are involved, and even the more important less-important characters are absent (Niobe, Ghost...).  It is literally as exciting as watching someone play a video game.  Without giving too much away, I'll say that it features the longest, most dull death scene in the history of cinema.  This is no exaggeration; I've seen every motion picture ever produced.  But hey, at least there was a lot of high-school-level philosophical speculation, if that interests you at all.To summarize: if you want to see a movie that has cool special effects, and a psuedo-cool fight scene, but disappointing acting and terrible, terrible writing, watch the latest "Star Wars" films.  If you want to bore someone you hate, buy them The Matrix: Revolutions.-SteveSteve5805@yahoo.com
