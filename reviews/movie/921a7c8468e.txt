Okay before people lose their minds, let me say, I thought the Two Towers was terrific, Fellowship of the Ring as well was great. The Return of the king is overlong, overwritten and far too grand. In fact it's so grand that the one loses an intimate connection with the characters. The formula it uses is- Build up to battle - Battle - Build up to battle - Battle - Half a dozen endings. It lacked the tightness of Fellowship of the Ring and the emotional touch of the Two Towers. It's too faithful an adaptation. They could have easily cut of an hour, and hour and a half from this movie. I don't get why this one gets all the credit.
