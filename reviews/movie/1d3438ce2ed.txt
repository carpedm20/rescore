A damn good action film that, thankfully, didn't waste the awesome opportunities it was given. The film doesn't patronise it's audience by explaining *everything*; the back story is neatly fleshed out in a pre-credits sequence (sort of like James Bond, really), and then the film is left to get on with things. There is some cheese, but it's done affectionately, such as Stacker Pentecost's rousing speech, or the "unproven rookie does good" thread with Mako Mori. But that's par for the course with action films these days, and it's never laid on too thick. One particular action sequence in the middle of film is worth the price of admission alone and, though I've never 'whooped' in a cinema before, I did mutter an "Oh wow" under my breath during a particularly awesome set-piece. As for mass appeal, I can imagine this being a good film to see with the family and I hope people are not put off by it's geeky affectations. I would definitely see this again, though perhaps not in 3D this time. Some of the fight scenes are a little difficult to follow in the murk. The guy sitting next to me actually held his hands up in a "What's going on?" gesture in the opening battle, and I laughed and nodded at him in agreement. 8 out of 10, and here's to the sequels!
