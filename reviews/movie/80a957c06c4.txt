Definitely the worst of the series. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've seen all of the movies several times now, and I can safely say that the ending, although it didn't answer every question, was satisfying in its own way. I've done a little bit of research, and I almost understand the way that the Matrix works. I also like to the view the three films as one big chronicle. The first one gives you a shocking concept, the second one shows you what can be done with this concept and gets you thinking even more (the Architect scene, for example), and the third one displays every technical ability that the Wachowskis and the cast members have learned, and mastered. The series as a whole is a stunning achievement.
