 I will admit that Pacific Rim did not turn out to be the movie I thought it was going to be, but all in all it is a better than average summer movie. The set pieces were pretty cool, and the robots and monsters almost warrant seeing the movie twice( just so you can catch some of the details you're bound to miss the first time). The acting is pretty solid and the CGI, of course,was awesome.
