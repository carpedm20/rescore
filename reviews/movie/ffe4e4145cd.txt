I don't purchase many dvds - but this one I am going to want to watch again and again. It's NOT about a dysfunctional family;(we just love to label families as dysfunctional, don't we?) it's about a very functional family living life! Certainly there are ebbs and flows in the collective life of each family - and this is a story about family members who each have their own struggles and sometimes step on each other as they navigate through their struggles.  But what they do, together, ultimately, is really wonderful.Each character was well cast and each actor did a GREAT job of showing us who their character was.Watch it while it's in the theatres if you can - but DO watch it! It will reaffirm for you that people really do want to take care of each other and allow each other to "be".
