Yeah, I know this film has a rep for being one of the worst films ever made & is considered by many to be highly offensive,... but, I really don't care. I thought it was the funniest, stupid movie I've probably ever seen! The fact that it's so panned universaly actually may have added to it's humor quotient as far as I'm concerned. A great cast of people, many of whom would probably not ever want to have this film brought up in conversation again, make it an even more joyous film viewing experience. Comedians Kevin Hart, D.L.Hughley,Mo'Nique, Geofrey, Loni Love,Tom Arnold,.. a whole host of hotties,.. and Snoop Dogg as the ghetto-fab, smoke tokin' pilot. Total stupidity & fun for all!  In real life, wouldn't go near an airline situation like that knowingly,... but as a DVD film entertainment,... repeat rides on this flight many times over!
