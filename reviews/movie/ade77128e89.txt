This final installment of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is a gigantic film-making feat. It may not feature the first film's dread or the second film's darkness, but feels more epic than both. Jackson has mastered the art of exploiting an unlimited fantasy lore and shaping it beautifully into stunning photography. The film's plot is once again well-structured and makes its magnificent acting performances feasible. The CGI battles are great, of course, and the whole experience is very rewarding. The pace is really good, except for the ending, which is a bit overly extended. I don't know if films like the "Lord of the Rings" will even exist again, but the whole trilogy is undeniably a classic.
