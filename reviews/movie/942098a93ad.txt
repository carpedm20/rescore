I caught this movie at a free screening and it has been a long time since I heard people clap and laugh hysterically (lots of snorting) in a theatre.  Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy with an indie feel and follows a family as they transport their daughter (Olive played by Abigail Brensen) to a children's beauty pageant via their VW bus. Many van breakdowns and other hijinx occur.  The movie is perfectly cast with many good comic actors, Greg Kinnear (determined Father), Steve Carell (suicidal Uncle), Alan Arkin (cracked out Grandfather), Toni Collette (seemingly functional Mother).  Abigail Brensen and Paul Dano (Dwayne, Olive's brother) really outshine in their roles.  The brother Dwayne does not even speak in his scenes for the majority of the movie but gives fantastic presence regardless.  They are a very funny, very dysfunctional family.
