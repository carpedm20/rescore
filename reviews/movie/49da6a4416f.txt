The title of my review says it all. Absolutely STUPID. I had low expectations when i walked in this movie, hoping that maybe it would've been good and I would've enjoyed. But no, the movie was everything I expected. Low grade dog crap! There's only a few funny parts in the movie, and then they get repeated over and over again. The toilet humor is over the top in this movie. The first couple of toilet jokes is funny, but when you keep goin with it its absolutely dull and annoying.Thank god the movie runs at a close 90 minutes. Any long, my girlfriend and I would've been out the door. Not only are the jokes stale, but we are presented with Snoop Dog's terrible acting and his doped up, slurred voice. Tom Arnold didn't seem himself in this movie either. No wonder, I wouldn't either if I was presented with a crap story and terrible actors to contend with.Overall, its simple. The movie sucked. Jokes were stale as two year old saltines, making it one of the worst comedies I've seen. Don't waste your six bucks on this way. Waste about 3.50 when it comes out on DVD and rent it.
