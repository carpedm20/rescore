When I first saw The Matrix, I was just blown away with the story.  I thought it was original and compelling.  The action was just fantastic to watch, so I was excited that they were going to make 2 more parts to the movie because the first one doesnt really explain what happens to Neo.  The second one, all though not as good as the first, had some really great action in it which made the movie for me and right then I just knew that while they had a really good story to develop, they were in it soley for the money and I knew the third was not going to live up to what could have been.  But of course, I went to go see it, along with all the other Matrix fans (who probably also new this was going to suck as well).  What a major let down.  This movie easily is in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.  While I liked the whole Anderson duplicating thing, everything else was just junk (except for the fights, which are still pretty good even though the special effects went down a notch).  And what a disappointing last fight.  It was taken straight out of the DragonBall Z cartoons (which I really dislike).  Again, what a let down.  What could have been a great trilogy because a joke in my eyes.  Spare yourself the frustration that comes with watching the death of the orginal Matrix movie.
