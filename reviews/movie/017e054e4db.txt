I loved this movie. I have to say, I wasn't expecting the biblical theme, I thought it was only about a couple of cavemen. And the part where Cain kills his brother and pretends Abel is still alive runs kind of long. Otherwise, the jokes were solid and the story well-crafted. It ran fluidly and was hilarious.  Cera and Black are perfect complements for each other. Anyone saying that they were just playing the same old roles are right, but that's the point, they've played it every other time. I don't understand how anyone who has watched them before wouldn't love the movie, or why anyone who didn't enjoy their previous roles would watch it in the first place.
