My husband and I watched this movie after my dad sent it to us labeling it a "have to watch as soon as possible" movie.  So we watched it right away, and it didn't disappoint.  We will probably be watching several times over again for years.  We cried, we laughed, we cried some more, and we laughed a lot.  And I screamed out of embarrassment during a pageant scene, which I won't mention, because the plot kind of revolves around it.Yeah, there's a lot of language, and it's not supposed to be a kid's movie.  I don't think the language was gratuitous - it fit the characters.  There are plenty of kids movies out this holiday season already.  Just because this movie is about a family doesn't mean that you should take your whole family (especially the little ones) to see it.This movie is raw and emotional.  The tension in Richard and Sheryl's marriage was almost unbearable.  You could tell that both of them wanted to do what was right to take care of their family, but they just had wildly opposite ways of getting there, and they didn't have the communication tools to actually talk about things, so instead they just shouted.  Actually, Richard pretty much shouts at everyone.  The irony of him being a self-help author is poignant.  Grandpa swears, is practically obsessed with sex, and snorts heroine, as others have mentioned.  But he was also in WWII, so I figure he earned the right to do just about anything he wants.  The family seems to think so too.The best part is, as others have mentioned, the fact that this functionally dysfunctional family was able to come together to support each other when they need to, and the love and acceptance that they ultimately give each other.I can't say enough good things about this movie.  It's great to see Hollywood doing movies that aren't all sugary and sweet, but deal with real  problems of real people, in a real way without neatly wrapped up endings.
