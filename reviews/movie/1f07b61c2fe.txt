I did not have too high expectations for this movie, the plot looked silly and the actors are not the best in Hollywood.  Suprisingly, the plot threw in many references to the Old Testament.  They followed books of the bible in a similar way that Forrest Gump followed events in 60's culture.  It was cleverly done.  I was pleased to see Paul Rudd, although for only a brief appearance.  Yes, it contained silly, teenage boy humor, but what else would you expect from a movie with Jack Black and Michael Cera?  If you like these guys, you'll probably like this movie.
