 I made the mistake of taking notice of the bad reviews Salvation got, which lead me to delaying purchasing this film. Having been a fan of the previous films, bar the third movie, I decided to buy Salvation. True, its nowhere near as good as the first two, but having watched the film myself, I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable, Christian Bale did a great job as John Connor.
