Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet little comedy starring Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets), Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Steve Carell (40-year Old Virgin), Alan Arkin (Glengarry Glen Ross), and young actors Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (Signs).The movie revolves around a typical American dysfunctional family: Richard, the dad, who is a terrible motivational speaker, always lectures his family members on the 9 steps to success, even though he's a failure himself; Sheryl, the mom, is completely passive; Dwayne, the son, hates his family and chooses not to speak to them at all; Uncle Frank tried to committ suicide over a male graduate student of his; Grandpa is a heroine snorter; and Olive, the chubby daughter and only hope for some ordinary life in the house, wants to become California's Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.After being informed that Olive has been picked as a contestant, the family hit the road to the beauty contest in a van that needs to be pushed to get going, and doesn't stop honking. In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.RecommendedB+
