This is a really good and very funny movie! It's perfect for the whole family! It has an awesome plot and great actors. Everbody did an awesome job! Kevin James stars as the lovable and dorky Paul Blart, who works as a Security Guard at West Orange Pavilion Mall. Nobody really likes Paul, except for his daughter and mother. Then, he meets Amy, played by the sexy beautiful Jayma Mays. Amy starts to like him, until he gets drunk at a bar. On Black Friday, criminals disguised as Santa's elves take over the mall and have 6 hostages, Amy included. When Paul finds out about Amy, he takes a stand and fights back against the bad guys. It's like Die Hard for ALL audiences. If you love comedy, you'll love PAUL BLART: MALL COP!!!
