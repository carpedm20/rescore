In the first Matrix, the W brothers took time away from the special effects and action sequences to EXPLAIN what was going on. There was a lot of explaining to do, and they made sure they did it. That's why people loved The Matrix. It was complex but it made sense.In this film, the second sequel to the original, nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. Characters show up and talk about philosophical concepts, making the plot pointlessly murky. The Oracle is a new woman, but it's not clear why (other than the fact that the original actress died). As the movie goes on, you find yourself collecting questions. Why is THAT happening? Why did they go THERE? Entire scenes have nothing to do with the plot. (Just try to figure out why the Merovingian is back. There's no explanation.)Rather than clear things up, you get one of the most overblown action sequences in the history of film. And it's boring. Yes, the special effects are impressive, but they seem too computerized (or stolen from other sci-fi movies) to hold your attention. In the documentary on the second disc, the filmmakers show how most of these effects were created with models, not on a computer. How could the models look so fake? It's an amazing feat to turn something real into something that seems artificial.I highly recommend avoiding this movie. It's simply a crude, thoughtless cash-in on the popularity of the first film. This movie (and Reloaded) will go down in history as the two worst sequels ever. The difference in quality between the first film and these sequels is so great, you can't help but wonder: What happened?
