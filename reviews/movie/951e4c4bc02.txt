Matrix Revolutions was interesting as sort of a post-modernistic blend of Christianity and Jungian psychology, but in the end it was a let down as an action adventure movie, and it's message was rather garbled.The main positive for me was that they didn't resort of one of those ubiquitous finales where some sort of clock is ticking down to disaster, with the world saved with 2 seconds to spare.But the ending was not very satisfying.  Nothing was resolved in any way that seemed permanent. The main characters were abandoned and minor characters pushed to the front of the stage.  What philosophical points it made were confused by the need to show something exploding, speeding, or performing Kung Fu every few minutes.
