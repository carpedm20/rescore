I thought Revolutions was an extremely satisfying ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. The conclusion of the movie seems to be knocked by people who simply don't understand it and don't have either the intelligence or the motivation to look beneath the film's glossy, special effects layers.Neo brings about the end of the war in a quite brilliant way - Agent Smith has grown beyond the machines' control and threatens the Matrix's (and therefore the machines') very existance. All of a sudden the balance of power shifts - the machines need a human to save them (how ironic!). And this is precisely what happens. Neo (in a highly religious and symbolic ending) allows Smith to assimilate him. This gives the machines access to the Smith program, allowing them to destroy him.In return for Neo's 'ultimate sacrifice' the war is called off and the salvation of Zion is assured.This movie works on so many levels - particularly biblical and Greek mythological ones. Even 50 viewings would not catch them all. I love the Matrix trilogy because I discover new things every time I watch them. I know of no other set of films that are as spectacular to watch and as thought provoking at the same time as the three Matrix films - well deserving the five star rating.
