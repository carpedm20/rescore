This isn't so much a review (I am writing one soon) as a short response to certain individuals who believe The Lord of the Rings films to be racist.The colors of black and white have been used to symbolize many things, and yes at times they represent evil and good - "black" symbolizes darkness and the unknown while "white" represents clarity and light. In this case, skin color is a non-factor.If anything, this film series turns the notion of white and black as good and evil on it's ear, because the villainous Sarumon was a "White" Wizard before Gandalf became so...and it's his evil army that bore the mark of the "White Hand of Sarumon" on their faces and armor!Obviously the African American Film Critics Association didn't detect any racism when they chose Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King as the best film of the year, and neither should anyone else!
