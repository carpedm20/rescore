I HAVE NOT LAUGHED THIS HARD IN A LONG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you are a 'stick in the mud' hater that doesnt understand non-stop slapstick comedy, then go see THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY again, but if you have any intention of laughing your a*s*s off then see this movie!Oh, everyone saying the main character is "Dakwon" or "Ackwan".........HIS NAME IS: NASHAWN WADEN.W.A. = NASHAWN WADE AIRLINES!By the way, Im Caucasian, listen to all types of music (including hip hop/dance/rap/etc, and love comedy movies........like the other person said THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE, IT"S A MOVIE!5 STARS!
