It's a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. What do you expect? It's a generic action movie at heart. You'll be able to predict the ending of the movie about 10 minutes in because it follows the exact blueprint of all action movies. But that's not a bad thing. The movie is full of awesome action, comic relief (Charlie Day... need I say more?) and generic pump-up speeches. And it's all awesome. It's a fun movie from beginning to end and has some of the coolest looking and sounding fights of any movie I've seen to date.
