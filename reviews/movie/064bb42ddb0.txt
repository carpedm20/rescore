Others have already left a plot synopsis, so I'll be brief.  This is the best movie I've seen in years. This film made me laugh,cry,and want to see more of the talented cast. The storyline is quirky - it's a tearjerker and comedy rolled into one fabulous tale. This is a movie that will go on my "keep" shelf. Although the "F" word is used liberally, it's still a heartwarming story of a band of misfits that happen to be family uniting to make one little girl happy. It's fabulous!
