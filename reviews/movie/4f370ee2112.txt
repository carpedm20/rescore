I was surprised to see that the movie theater was PACKED for this show (and mostly all adults, too, which was a nice change). Every single actor in this movie delivered a top-notch performance, even when just letting expressions speak for then - I especially liked the teenage boy character. Almost every scene is genuinely funny but there are some understated, painfully realistic, sad moments. A great, funny movie for adults who want to see a smart movie that doesn't rely on special effects or Hollywood hearthrob-type stars, but rather a good script and wonderful and touching performances
