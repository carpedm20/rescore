After seeing the trailers and talking it over with a couple friends of mine, I wasn't really excited for it, but then July 12th drew closer and closer, I was getting more and more excited. After watching it I was shocked on how well it was put together. CGI was pretty good. I mean who doesn't like giant bad ass robots fighting these ugly looking aliens. Any kid would enjoy this movie. Maybe not little kids that might have nightmares over the aliens as they will be afraid to swim. Overall it was actually funny, interesting, action packed (except for the middle for like 30 minutes), but other than that it was well worth seeing. Go see it kids and whoever else. Whoever gave this movie under a 6 is a dumbass and/or don't have a sense of a kid side in them
