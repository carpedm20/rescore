A flawless movie that might be one of the best ever made. Stunning, massive, entertaining, deep, touching and dramatic. Those words truly illustrates how great this last installment of The Lord of the Rings is. The high amount of action and the uniqueness keeps me entertained, but also the coolness. The ending in The Return of the King is in level with The Dark Knight Rises and Inception, so itâ€™s spectacular and fascinating, but also sad. It's extremely hard to illustrate my feelings about The Return of the King, because that would only result in an emotional response. The Return of the King is both fantastic and spectacular. The Return of the King gets a 10/10
