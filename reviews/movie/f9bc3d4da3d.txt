 Truly EPIC movie from start to finish. Hands down the best movie so far this summer and a very very nice surprise. Did not expect to like it this much, The kid inside me was coming out like a chest buster from Aliens. Grand scale, great special effects, amazing sound effects, decent acting, and above avg story/script. Worth seeing.
