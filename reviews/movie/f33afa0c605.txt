Terminator Salvation might not be the sequel that most Terminator fans will be looking for, but its full of action packed scenes which will leave you in suspense and wanting for more. The storyline takes place in the somewhat distant future from the previous movies and explains on the origin of the original Terminator, however with known foresight by the main character John Conner after his adventures in T2 and T3.
