Easily the best action movie this year. Pacific Rim does something actually unexpected: Its really good, and it keeps you invested. Guillermo Del Toro take relativity unknown actors, mixed in with some more better known ones and makes this massive, visually enticing film that only leaves you wishing and/or wanting more. Will the sequel come? That'll be something for Warner Bros. to decide, but if they want another hit, green light the sequel and let Del Toro do his thing. This movie more than makes up for the disaster horror movie he released earlier in the year, in "Mama". Nobody was expecting this to be what it has become, so its easily a major surprise. I wouldn't go so far as to say, "best movie of the year" (that, personally for me, still lies with "The Place Beyond The Pines"). Its certainly best Action Movie of the year, and biggest surprise of the year. Worth seeing. Very fun adventure.
