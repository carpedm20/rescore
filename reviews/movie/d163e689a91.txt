An absolutely brilliant movie, in all aspects. The CG, the set pieces, the acting, everything is amazing. But when the movie is over, you dont remember the gimmicks and embellishments as much as you remember the incredible amount of heart in this movie. Unlike most movies in the fantasy genre, this movie doesnt rely on effects and hundreds of effects to amaze. Even though this movie has all you could want in these aspects, it also has a vibrant, ever present soul, and this is what makes it one of the best movies ever made, and probably the greatest fantasy or epic ever made
