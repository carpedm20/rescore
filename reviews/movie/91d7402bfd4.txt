I saw this movie as a sneak preview, and all I have to say is that this movie is by far the funniest and smartest comedy of all time, with a little of "National Lampoons Vacation" but with the indie charm of "You, Me and Everyone We Know," Little Miss Sunshine brings to the screen a heartfelt irony of pain and love with every character presenting a full personality not hollowed or spoiled by cheap antics or bad acting.
