Hmm...not the worst movie ever, but still not great. (Before I do anything else with this review, I have to say the user who complained about the contradiction between the original and the sequels is wrong: the Machines were manipulating the One so that he had to reboot the system periodically to keep it running.) This movie does have its moments--Sati is cute, in particular, and the assault on Zion shows remarkably subdued mindless action--but they're counterbalanced by the mediocre and outright bad. As an example, the scene near the end where Trinity flies above the clouds and sees the sun is simply beautiful--or it would be if the craft hadn't lost power as a consequence and crashed. Not only was it sad for me to see Trinity, my personal favourite character, die, it also struck me as unnecessarily cruel and a devaluation of her character. What happened to how capable she was in the first two films? Also, the final battle between Neo and Smith did take a bit too long to end. But I did actually understand pretty much all of it.
