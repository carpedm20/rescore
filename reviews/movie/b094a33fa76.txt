I feel that this movie is very underrated. I will admit this movie is basically a 2-hour action sequence, and that it can be fairly dull at times, as well as slightly moving away from all the philosophy in The Matrix Reloaded. However, the ending to this film is what made it an 8/10 for me. A fight very iconic, and an epic soundtrack that really helps set the scale, I really love this ending. NOT SPOILING IT.
