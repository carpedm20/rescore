Just a short while ago, I was remarking to a friend on how it would be nice to visit the old AIRPLANE franchise again.  Although this is no AIRPLANE III, this is definitely as close as your going to get.  Catered to a more urban audience, but appealing to us white boys as well, SOUL PLANE tells the story of a man who wins a lawsuit against an airline and then decides to start his own.  Every racial stereotype manages its way into the film and there are plenty of yucks to go around no matter what your color or nationality.  Filled with sex and harsh language, this is probably the furthest thing from a politically correct movie you'll find this year.It's also absolutely hysterical!
