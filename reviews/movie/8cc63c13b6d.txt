More of a drama than a comedy, this poignant film I believe is probably the best movie of 2006.  Each of the characters is absurd but oddly believable.  Many touching moments.  An unpredictable but uplifting ending. Great acting.  The little girl could charm a grizzly bear. Despite her external imperfections, her big heart, touching naivete and optimistic attitude will captivate you.  I guarantee you will walk out of this movie a better person and with a smile on your face.  How many films can do that?
