An amazing movie, where cliches didn't bothered me, because it was compensated with the astonishing special effects, the creativity of the Jaegers design, and the emotion that is injected to your bloodstream when you see them fight in unique and incredible locations. The acting was also amazing and it had very funny moments, classic of a Mexican director. I was also excited because it reminded me the classics of Evangelion and Godzilla, being mixed up to become a stronger entretaining movie. Very well done del Toro!
