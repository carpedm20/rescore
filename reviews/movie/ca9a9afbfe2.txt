 Took me back to the early 80s, when Robotec and Godzilla ruled my world; to all the weird and wonderful Japanese toys and cartoons that infiltrated my youth. I love it. It's a lot of fun, excellent special effects. The story may seem simple, and it is, but really it is paying homage to all the classic Japanese movies that inspired it. Very cool.
