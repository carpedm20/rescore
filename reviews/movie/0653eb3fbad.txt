I dont understand the horrible reviews here!  This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Maybe people come into this not really knowing what to expect?  So I will say, if you know who Jack Black is, and you think hes funny, then you will love this movie.  Its hilarious.  I wasnt as familiar with Michael Cera, but hes hilarious as well.  This supposedly takes place in year 1AD, but the movie is filled with modern day language and terminology.  So that is one aspect that makes this movie funny.  For example, in the beginning of the movie they are referring to themselves as hunters and gatherers.  I just thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  And if youre interested, I suggest you ignore these ridiculously bad reviews and check this movie out.  I'm ordering it on Blu-Ray now...
