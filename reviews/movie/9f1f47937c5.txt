My husband and I watched the unrated version of this movie and we were practically in tears from laughing so hard.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews.  I havent seen the theatrical version, but maybe it's not as funny.  Just wanted to throw my 2 cents in there because this is one of our new favorties :)
