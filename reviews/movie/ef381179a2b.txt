A Flawless job by Peter Jackson. this movie has everything! Action, Adventure, Romance..etc. and the digital effects are amazing!! i had no idea they had the kind of equipment to make such amazing effects! and i see a lot of people complaining about the length of the movie. And i must agree the length of the movie is kinda long..running over 3 hours long. but its better than making 5-6 lotr..right? i think 3 lotr movies is the perfect sequel and this movie will be known for awhile..
