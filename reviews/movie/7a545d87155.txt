Little Olive, age 6, wants to be a beauty queen. Yeah, but daddy wants to be a motivational speaker and he can't. Big brother wants to be a pilot and he can't. Uncle wants to be an academic success and he can't. Grandpa wants to be something - anything - and he can't. That leaves little Olive, supporting the whole weight of their failure on her small and sloping shoulders, so off they go to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.Off in an ancient VW minibus, with mechanical condition that fully matches their personal condition - things happening that shouldn't, not happening that should, and utter collapse certain even if the moment of that collapse isn't so easy to predict. And so they arrive at the pageant, a bizarre world in itself. It's filled with six year old beauty queens in tiny flat bikinis, elaborate makeup and big hair, trying to be the seductresses that their mothers never were. And Olive, with her six year old babyfat and gawky walk, wondering why she doesn't have the taut tummy that the others do (and shouldn't).Then it all comes down to the final talent competition, the one that Olive has been practicing for months and the crowning moment of the family's out-to-lunchness. How could mommy and daddy NOT have known what kind of routine she was developing with grandpa? No matter, they're all a family.If you enjoy the kind of entertainment that leaves you happy that you're not them, you'll love it. Although the movie had its moments, I found it a bit creepy that anyone might be them.//wiredweird
