I was crying when the movie ended and for so many reasons. This movie is easily the greatest and most powerful of the three movies in Peter Jackson's future classic legacy "Lord Of The Rings" and will go down into the same category as "Wizard Of Oz", "The Godfather" and "Citizen Kane" as one of the greatest movies that has ever been made. Perfectly picking up where "The Two Towers" left off, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are approaching ever closer to Mt. Doom in Mordor but Frodo is falling further and further into despair as the power of the Ring is increasing. Meanwhile, Gollum has some nefarious plans of his own that they aren't aware of yet. Meanwhile Minas Tirith, the capitol of Gondor, is under seige by massive armies loyal to Sauron and the dark powers are spreading all over Middle Earth, causing death and destruction in the process. Time is running out, friendships are tested, powers both good and evil, start breaking down, armies start moving, and the days are growing darker as the fate of Middle Earth hangs by a thread. This movie is extremely intense. Arguably the darkest of the three, this brings the epic trilogy to a powerful and tearjerking end. I cried not only because of the powerful ending but because a great era in moviemaking has come to a conclusion. But we will someday see this again on the big screen someday and perhaps the extended editions back to back. We'll see.... Until then, go and see this movie right away. You will never experience anything like this again.
