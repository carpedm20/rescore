Final part of the trilogy. In many ways, this is the most massive of the three - a massiveness which bothered me at times. Great armies clashing together in two worlds, "gods" fighting in the sky... The visuals are as amazing as usual. The fights, the special effects, and the sounds go well together. Most bothersome aspect of the movie is the complex final collision of Neo and Smith, though. There is ideology, but even after multiple watches some of the fine reasons fly by my head, still. So many people scheming and planning, truths that are revealed, and some of them are less important than others, contributing to build a world we want to know but can't fully grasp. But what rates this movie higher in my book is the ending; finally a movie where heroes, too, can die! Though the evil is beaten (for now), this is still nice and different. In my opinion, 'Matrix' is one of the best trilogies/series ever made, because all three parts are almost equally good. You don't find that just anywhere these days.
