A single, suburban dad tries to make ends meet as a security officer at a New Jersey mall. It's a job he takes very seriously, though no one else does. When Santa's helpers at the mall stage a coup, shutting down the megaplex and taking hostages (Paul's daughter and sweetheart among them), Jersey's most formidable mall cop will have to become a real cop to save the day. Refreshing to see a movie without bad language, unnecessary sexual content, good script writing, and enjoyable throughout. Characters were real and relatable and very funny.
