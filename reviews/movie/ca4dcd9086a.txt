watching a bunch of giant robots fighting monsters is awesome. There is no denying that. Pacific Rim embodies this notion. Pacific Rim is The robot vs monster movie. That being said, everything else about it is pretty damn terrible. The actors are all trying way too hard and it seems that everyone involved was having a hard time taking the subject matter seriously. Maybe because everything in this movie has been done before. The whole plot is ripped from every aliens attack movie. "Aliens attack and humans put aside their petty differences to work together to destroy the attackers". Its so cliché its ridiculous. I was constantly having flash backs to other movies. Most notably would be of course Godzilla, Transformers and also Independence day. Even the ending reeked of Indep Day. The black market for kaiju parts was somewhat interesting but it was all way too Hollywood. The scientist's were also vaguely interesting but watching them interact and grow as characters made me want to puke. Jackson Teller just looks like he hopped out of Sons of Anarchy and into a robot suit. Again, robots fighting monsters will always be cool and the special effects are top notch but everything else is unintentionally cheesy and cliché, its very much similar to the Transformers series.
