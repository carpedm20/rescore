Little Miss Sunshine is so funny it actually hurts.  I was laughing so hard I was crying for most of the movie, its that good.  That being said it is a fabulous drama.  One of the best films of the year.  The writing, which is great portrays the most realistic family I've seen on screen in a really long time!  If you love smart humor and drama that is as funny as life you must watch this movie!
