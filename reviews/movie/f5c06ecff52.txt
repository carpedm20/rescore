I seem to find myself in the minority here, but I actually liked "Year One".  Having seen it in the theater, I thought it was a fairly fun and light-hearted experience all around.  The humor is perhaps not as broad as some prefer-but myself, I sort of enjoyed the subtleties.  These type of films usually benefit from a second or even third viewing if you give them a chance.In "Year One", Jack Black plays his part adequately but seems to yield the majority of the spotlight to his on-screen cohort Michael Cera.  Michael Cera is the real star of "Year One" and Black seems to know it-taking a step back for the younger comedic actor to really shine.  Cera's comedic delivery is dry and spot-on for his character "Oh" and he plays the part with real charismatic charm.  In short, it is Cera's film, not Black's-and I wouldn't have had it any other way.When it comes down to it, Year One is just a harmless little diversionary film which doesn't take itself too seriously and nor should you.  I personally thought it had a lot of wit and charm.  Perhaps it just didn't strike the majority of audiences in the same way.  That's too bad too because personally, I found this film far more entertaining than some of the summer's bloated special effects films.Surprisingly, this film looks amazing on Blu-Ray too-especially the city scenes.
