 I went in wanting an epic movie about Giant robots, and I got it. The fight scenes were well done and at times pretty intense. The story in between was a bit ho hum, but I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I think this movies succeeds in what it set out to do, and what us Giant Robot fans expected.
