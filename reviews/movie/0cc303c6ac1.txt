Sam Worthington made this film, That was the one thought I kept when I watched this film because it was true. He outshined everyone easily and this film was easily the film that sort of launched him into the spotlight. Christian Bale was solid ,as was the rest of the cast, and the action was good. Yet the plot was just too boring and wasnt interesting, It was rather tough to sit through. Its just a solid action flick imo.
