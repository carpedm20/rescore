I've watched this several times and keep discovering things I didn't notice previously. Some of the best humor isn't in the lines the actors use, it's the whole scene and the crazy situations they get themselves into. LOVE the twist on biblical stories. It's almost like a "Scary Movie" for the all those Sunday School stories you learned as a kid. Too Funny!
