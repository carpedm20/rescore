This movie definitly has slow parts and jokes that don't always work as well as intended, so don't expect this to be a summer blockbuster. Don't have any high expectations for any Jack Black movie or Michael Cera movie really... If you like history or the humanitites you will definitly enjoy this movies multiple settings as they go through the early centuries. I would recommend at least a rental, if you're bored and are looking for something to mindlessly enjoy.
