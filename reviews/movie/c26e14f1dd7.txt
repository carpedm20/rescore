In a world where every second movie in this genre is based on a comic book comic book character(s) it's refreshing seeing something new, especially when these guys actually try and create a bit of story and not just mindless action even though there is allot of that. The only negatives to this movie for me would be the fact that for some reason most fights happen in darkened environments; and on one or two sections I found the writing script to be sub par, but nothing to take away from the enjoyment of the movie. Other than that I much prefer this movie to the latest incarnation of the Superman franchise.
