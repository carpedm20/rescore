This film makes use of anachronisms, puns, and other devises to pock fun at history, philosophy, theology, the Bible, biblical language, sex, Rome, God, and other subjects. It is also filled with the ridiculous, such as when one of the heroes is chained upside down in prison and pees, and the urine flows down over his head, or when he saves a virgin from being a sacrifice by having sex with her. The story begins when one of two foolish cave men friends eats the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and thinks that he has suddenly and miraculously become smart. But the other inhabitants of the cave men village exile him for his sin, and he discovers the use of fire when he accidentally burns down the village. His friend joins him in the exile. They decide to go to the end of the earth and see the phenomenon. They run into Cain and Abel on the other side of the mountain and see the former kill the later. They drive in a cart, which has wheels, a new invention they had never seen before, and become seasick in the slow ox-pulled cart. There is a slow moving ox-cart chase when Cain's father chases him because of the murder. The two cave men encounter Abraham and stop him from sacrificing his son Isaac. When Abraham tells them that he heard from God that he needs to cut people's foreskin, they escape to the city of joy, Sodom. There they learn that it hasn't rained for a long time. One of them enters the holy of holies, which is forbidden, for if a person enters, he will die. When he exits the holy of holies unharmed, people think that he is the "chosen one." These are just some of the many adventures.
