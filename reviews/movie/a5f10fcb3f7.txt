This film is hilarious. If you look past the mediocre storyline and catch the hidden and sometimes obvious jokes, you will appreciate this comedy a lot more. I have a broad sense of humor and my comedic attitude stretches across the horizon so this film may be easier for someone like me to enjoy. But to totally bash this film because Jack Black sucks or Michael Cera is predictable? If you don't like these actors to begin with, don't watch the movie! Hank Azaria is classic hilarious, David Cross and Paul Rudd are perfect, Bill Hader is a brief, but great touch, and Juno Temple, June Diane Raphael, and Olivia Wilde are smoking hot in this. Have an open mind and broaden your sense of humor.
