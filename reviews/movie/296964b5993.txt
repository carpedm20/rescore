I'm pretty sure this is the longest movie I have ever seen. I watched the extended addition, and I'm guessing that it was around four and a half hours. But wow was it worth it. Everything about this movie is spot on, grand, and epic. The battles, the journey, and the stakes are greater than ever. I was so entertained through the whole thing that I lost track of time, and the four hours just flew by.
