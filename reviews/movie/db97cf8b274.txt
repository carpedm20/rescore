I know its still early in the year, but Soul Plane is already in the lead for "Worst Movie of the Year". Director Jessy Terrero is now TRYING to defend this movie, but its no use. This movie relies heavily on sex, bathroom and race jokes that are offensive, of bad taste and -worst of all- unfunny. For example, when a blind man feels up a baked potato and orgasms based on what he thinks he is experiencing, I winced in embarrassment for the actor. Not only does the film offer ridiculous stereotypes (of Blacks, Middle Easterners, Gays, Whites etc.), the film insults the intelligence of the audience. Example, NWA's concourse is named X (after Malcolm). It comes complete with a basketball court, 99 cent store, and the terminal restaurant is Roscoe's Chicken n' Waffles. The plane is equipped with a dance club and a studio for making hip-hop music videos, the bathroom is equipped with a fold-out table for wannabe mile high clubbers, and the choice of drink for coach class is malt liquor. And the white characters carry the last name 'Honkee.' The acting was HORRIBLE!! Only Tom Arnold shines in this mess. He was the only one with any sense of comic timing. I almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theatre (the first time ever), half the crowd (about 10) got up and left before it was over. I wasted 90 minutes of my life, but do yourself a favor and AVOID!!
