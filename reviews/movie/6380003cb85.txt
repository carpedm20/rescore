Neo wore a dress. And what's up with his "DragonBall Z" fight with Smith? Couldn't they have stayed on the ground for more than 2 seconds? Oh and Naomi, about them not answering any questions for you, but rather only making more questions for you because they didn't even know what they were talking about so they tried to confuse you and sound all smart and deep when really all they needed to say at the end was ..... THIS MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME! PLEASE FORGIVE US FOR WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY AND YOUR DAY! Don't you want something to talk about at the end of a movie rather than . . . "What the heck just happened?" I loved the 1st Matrix and after the first 40 minutes of the second one, I liked that one too. But c'mon . . . all of you die-hard (...) Matrix fans need to open your eyes and see that they should have stopped after the first one. The first Matrix was something new and exciting. But why over-do it with two more? Neo tore things up in the first two movies . . . why does he have to be a dress maker all of a sudden in the third movie? And to top all of that off, a sunset arises and a stupid girl says, "Look fake oracle, I made that for Neo. HUCK!" Did I just waste 5 minutes typing a review about the worst movie I've seen (...) But Matrix Revolutions made me cry! Actually, I had wasted so much time seeing the movie, I didn't even bother crying. Don't waste your time with this movie. And if you already have ... you don't have to anymore.
