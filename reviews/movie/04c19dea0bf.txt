Although it didn't turn out to be the film I wanted it to be it still is an epic and very spectacular movie. The Battles are visually very rich and the VFX still hold up very well for an almost 10 year old film. The Messiah story is filled with philosofical content with which you might not always agree but it does provide food for thought and the films tend to stick in your mind much more than the modern day action fodder tends to do. This makes seeing these gems on Blu-ray again as much a joy as they first times I saw them at the cinemas!
