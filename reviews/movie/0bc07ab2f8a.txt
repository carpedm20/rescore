Just absolutely marvelous. It takes what made its predecessors so amazing and added more amazing on top of it. The acting is great as usual, the battle sequences are masterfully filmed, and the film just really beautiful all around. The CGI, the story, the cinematography, just brilliantly done. Also, as with the first two, the film watching experience is entirely magical. It really wisks you away to another land and engulfs you in the happenings as if it is happening in your world. It is hard to put my finger on what makes this series so great, but I think we get a taste of it at the end as even when this film, the final in the trilogy, ended I was left wanting more. Over three hours was simply not enough of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, etc, for me, which is an amazing thing to say. As for the ending, it is great, though it does go on a tad too long for my liking and is not as great as the rest of the film, but it works and it is pretty satisfying. The Lord of the Rings is one of the rare film franchises that gets better as it goes on, though that is not to say the first two are bad, as they are just as good as this one. I am sad now that is over, but I guess that is to be expected.
