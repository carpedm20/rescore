This movie is what I'd consider the "Transformers" movie that never made. The feel of this really big. It's really made on such a large scale. It's a fun movie that everyone will enjoy. As far as storytelling goes, it's decent. But lets face it, no one's going to watch this movie for the story. Yet, there are characters that are really good like Idris Elba and Charlie Day. There are others that are also pretty good like Charlie Hunnam. And then there are those that you honestly just don't care about. But the ginormous fight scenes are visually breathtaking. You'll feel like you're actually in the fight. Overall, it's a fun, exciting and visual masterpiece.
