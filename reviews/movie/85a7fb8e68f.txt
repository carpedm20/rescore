By far the worst of the futuristic trilogy by the Wachowski Brothers. Matrix Revolutions focuses too much on the special-effects of the movie and in turn, results in a sloppy script, mediocre storyline and a disappointing conclusion to The Matrix Trilogy. The atrocious film detaches from the other two movies of the trilogy (The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded) and leaves a bad taste for the viewers, expecting a decent conclusion to a series that could be made into something that will be remembered for the generations for come.
