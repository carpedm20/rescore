Arguably one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time. Peter Jackson conducted a master-stroke of cinema that managed to captivate an entire generation. With this movie and its prequels, Tolkien's magnum opus has become the definitive fantasy legendarium that others aspire to. But. Return of the King is not THE perfect movie. There are some flaws in it, albeit minor, that detract from the experience and may dismay hardcore LOTR fans. None of these flaws lie in the production or direction in and of itself, but rather some continuity issues and some questionable additions and omission of some material from the books. However, only one flaw is really worth mentioning, and that is the inclusion of the Army of the Dead in the Battle of Pelennor. This move conveys the notion that PJ sought to sway people who either didn't care about LOTR or fantasy in general, or simply to add cinematic flair and "awesomeness" to the movie. An understandable move, for sure. But this scene may leave some hardcore fans dissatisfied with the experience. However, I myself wasn't put off by the scene itself, as it served the purpose of ending the battle and ushering in the conclusion of the movie. Again, understandable, considering the fact that an entire book had to have been "crammed" into a ~210 minute-long movie. In general though, I was immensely satisfied with the movie and its prequels. Return of the King will be immortalized as one of the greatest movies of all time, and I doubt that this feat will be replicated in the future. I give The Return of the King a score of 10, despite the minor flaws I mentioned above. They were not enough to detract from my wonderful experience with the movie.
