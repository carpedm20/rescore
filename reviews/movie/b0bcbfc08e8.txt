Let's get one thing straight:  "The Matrix Revolutions" has none of the reality-bending plot twists nor the eye-opening originality of the first.  The final chapter in the trilogy is an altogether different type of movie.  Although it cannot compete against the original, it competes strongly against other entries in the action/adventure genre.  With the requisite battle scenes that pit the underdog against a superpower, "The Matrix Revolutions" is a fast-paced, adrenalin-packed movie that owes its entertainment to action and special effects.  Despite this, the viewer must listen and watch carefully, as in the other two, to understand why events unfold as they do.The plot is difficult to detail without spoilers since many of the most shocking revelations come at the beginning, before the high-stakes battle scenes begin.  Let it suffice to say that Neo has become something more than we thought, and as a result, he is much more of a threat to the nefarious virus Agent Smith.  When the Oracle indicates (or does she?) that Neo is Zion's only hope, he and Trinity break off from the others who are hunkering down for an all-out assault of Zion.  This is the strongest indicator that the third of the trilogy has stepped away from philosophical sci-fi and into pure action, as Neo and Trinity disappear from the screen for long stretches.  Their onscreen time is limited, as is their plot; this will disappoint many diehard fans.  Still, the action sequences are breathless (although eventually overdone) and the special effects are first-rate.  The resolution of the trilogy is both surprising and inevitable, the hallmark of a well-prepared story.  If you've been paying attention, it will make complete sense.I recommend you approach this film without high expectations.  Comparing it to the first will only disappoint you.  Expect instead something along the lines of the "Terminator" movies, and you'll enjoy every minute.
