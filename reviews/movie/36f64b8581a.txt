 It's not as good as first two films (considering the depth, story, plot altogether) because it focuses more on action rather than story. In this film there are more fighting scenes, massive battles, etc. If you like bullets flying, explosions, BOOM, CRASH, TRATa Ta Ta Ta Ta.... etc. then you'll definitively like it.
