Soul Plane does not make any sense. It's an Airplane wannabe with a ghetto twist and half the laughs. It's stirred controversy in the black community by being called 'racist' and an insult to black people. But it's still a pretty fun ride, and not very racist at all. While the humor is crass and edgy, I think it was all played for laughs and not meant to be taken seriously. And while the film was stupid and idiotic, it managed to entertain. It's 90 minutes of silly entertainment, not to be given much thought to. Rather, it's a chance to suspend disbelief, relax, and escape into the zaniness. People are taking this film a little too seriously. It's not meant for that, it's meant to be a light, fluffy, and zany comedy with some crude homor thrown in. For that, it succeeds. I won't remember this film tomorrow, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.
