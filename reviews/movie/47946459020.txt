For all their talents, it's really sad to see these actors in a film such as this. Guess great movie roles are far and few in between. Enough to sell your soul to act in an ignorant production like this one.  "Soul Plane" is the dumbest, the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. Like many others I didn't watch the whole movie. The first few minutes embarrassed me. At best, it's piss poor comedy that perpetuates terrible sterotypes upon just about everyone.
