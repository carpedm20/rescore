We went to see this and loved it!  It was part boy-meets-girl, part cops & robbers, part ninja stunts, part average-guy-succeeds, part sweet dad, part slapstick, part irony of human relationships, but all funny.  And the music was GREAT!  Went home and immediately signed up to get the sound track when it becomes available.  If I'm looking for something dark and ponderous, I watch PBS or Ingrid Bergman.  If I'm looking for something factual, I watch a documentary.  If I need to be updated on current events, I watch (or read)the news. But if I need to laugh hard and feel better when I leave, Mall Cop is perfect.  And the music is just terrific!  Spans time and memories of my past, but is also this-very-minute, 2009.  Can't wait to hear it again!  Just all depends what you're looking for. . . .
