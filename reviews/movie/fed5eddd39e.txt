Matrix I was a triumph of the marriage between a Hong Kong style kungfu fu flick and the typical Hollywood blockbuster. It had jaw-dropping action sequences and CGI effects that blew everybody away and set the standard for future CGI-infused thrillers. What made it so memorable was that it had a story, a plot and a concept all neatly rolled into one. It was so engaging that by the time the credits were rolling, you almost wanted to cry of relief that you're still in the real world and at the same time pray that the Matrix doesn't really exist.Fast forward to November 2003 and here we are at the screening of the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy. After the debacle that was Matrix Reloaded, expectations are high as the W brothers try to redeem themselves with a bang of an ending. To be fair, M3 is better than M2. Much better. The CGIs are still quite breathtaking albeit less explosive, and there is actually a semblance of a plot this time round. Gone is the technobabble that threatened to sink M2. In its place is simple logic and heart which leads us to an inevitable showdown between Neo and Smith(s).Sadly, there is minimal character development and the lead actors are pretty much left to their own devices to try and spice things up with whatever dismal lines that they are given. In fact Neo and gang actually disappear halfway through the show leaving only the CGI sentinels to salvage whatever dignity this trilogy had. As a result, nothing of importance really happens until the final half hour of the movie and by then you would've stopped caring for whomever it was that survived the invasion.Finally, the way they wrapped it up is inconclusive, messy and totally not worth all the trouble the original writers took to create an alternative reality and fate. Which begets the question: How did something which started out so well end up so bad?
