I have never watched the other Terminator movies - at least not well enough to remember them - but the lack of Schwarzenegger AND the presence of Bale & Worthington definitely made me want to watch this one. And I don't regret it for a second! Plus by now, I think this is the movie I've rewatched most times. The plot is a steady roll of awesome stuff; fighting, searching, discovering. The plot: Marcus Wright is sentenced to death, agreeing to donate his body to some new research, but wakes up in the world of 2018 where the machines and Skynet have taken over. He doesn't know exactly how he got there, and the further his road takes him, the more terrible the truth. Not to mention when he realizes he has been changed, and a certain John Connor seems to be of the opinion that he is not what he firmly believes he is: human. I think Marcus' (Sam Worthington) story outweighed John Connor's (Christian Bale), although their stories mingled by the end. The last scenes in San Francisco were a bit of a mess, losing in coherency compared to the beginning of the movie, but nonetheless, the plot was very clear until then, and I didn't mind it too much. Besides, the story wrapped itself up pretty well. The movie looked and sounded good, which is essential for movies like this. I think the characters also worked very well. The story was solid from beginning to end, with clear objective and no unnecessary scenes/characters/relationships to mess it up. Some of the small references to past movies (and the TV show?) made it hard to comprehend certain things, but it wasn't too much to make me confused or annoyed, so I can recommend this movie to anyone who likes men fighting machines, and all that stuff. Awesome!
