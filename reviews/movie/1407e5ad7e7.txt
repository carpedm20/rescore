The "Citizen Kane" of spectacle films. It wears it's identity as a spectacle film on its sleeve and that will turn off some. For the rest of us we get some of the most fun we've had in a theater all summer. Everything from the music to the production design get you amped for the next monster encounter. Del Toro captures lighting in a bottle by giving us a spectacle film that also has a depth of mythology not seen in these types of films. It's biggest weakness is the wooden characters and cliched tropes, but even these feed into what Del Toro was trying to do which is give us a live action anime of sorts. Those flaws do not outweigh the genius of the robot on monster fights. This film delivered everything as advertised.
