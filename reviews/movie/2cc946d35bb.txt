Given the large numbers of people who referred to this silly little movie as one of the worst ever, I wonder where we draw the line between critical assessment and pure gut reaction in forming our opinions of entertainment. What separates Step Brothers, which I hated, from Mall Cop, which I enjoyed? Why did this movie work whereas Funny People, another more critically received Sandler project, disappointed me?There is little original in the story, there are the predictable credibility issues (young attractive girl falls for shleppy overweight loser - oh, what hath Seth Rogen wrought?), and there's Sandler's penchant for schlocky 80s pop music touchstones that buddy Kevin James is borrowing, but still I found myself laughing out loud during much of this movie even when I saw the gag coming from a mile away. Either my opinion isn't worth squat or the reviewers who tore this movie to shreds need to lighten up. Or maybe neither. Maybe individual taste is just too complex to figure out and the reasons we react the way we do to entertainments aren't so important after all. All I know is that I liked Mall Cop. I laughed a fair amount. I would watch it again. Does that qualify as an endorsement?
