I was pleasantly entertained. Pacific Rim stands as a testament to how far advanced Hollywood is these days, as so little of this movie was actually filmed in real locations around the world. The execution to that end was superb very high quality a la Transformers but with a bit more humanity (which makes sense, seeing how they're basically oversized Iron Man outfits with two pilots). There was a big opportunity to really flesh out a high quality plot and drive character development with the time they spent on both, but I never felt like they ever really get emotionally invested in either of those points to where the I cared who lives and dies. But as the movie wrapped up, I simply said to those around me "that was actually pretty good", and left it at that. There's not much else to say or expect. But I definitely saw higher potential, one that would have set this movie in a much higher league, and that opportunity was unfortunately missed.
