I might be in minority here, but I really enjoyed this film.  I didn't expect a master piece, but a light-hearted and fun movie and that is exactlly what this movie is.  The two stars, Black and Cohort play their roles very nicely.  The delivery is dry and matter of fact and it makes it more fun.  I give it five star because watching it, I laughed and after the movie, I felt happy and still smiled at remembering some of the scenes and  lines.
