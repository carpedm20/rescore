There is absolutely nothing good to be said about this filthy piece of low grade stereotyped garbage that's an insult not only to black people, but to whites and anybody with an IQ over 12! Basically, this ignorant fool and his (amazingly) dumber cousin sue an airline after getting stuck in the toilet and use the $ to buy SOUL PLANE. On board are strip clubs, cockfighting, malt liquor, and discos. Snoop is brought on board as a jailhouse pilot who has never actually flown a plane, the ever-emabrrassing Mo'Nique plays down to her usual standard as a foulmouthed sex-starved security guard. Tom Arnold makes this movie an equal opportunity offender as "Mr. Hunkee" (Come on! Calling white folks "Honkies" went out with George Jefferson) and "comedienne" Sommore as an oversexed hot mama who uncontrollably tries to consumate her relationship with her boyfriend wherever she can. The blacks in this "film" consistantly refer to each other as the n-word and the (mostly) scantily clad women are shamelessly referred to by the b-word. Weed smoking is constant. These are TRAGIC (not funny) things that intelligent people are trying to STAMP OUT in Black America, and trash like this isn't helping! I say to use this DVD as a frisbee since it would not fit in the toilet where it REALLY belongs!
