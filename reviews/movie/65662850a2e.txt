As brilliant and great as the film was, there were still plenty of flaws; Charlie Hunnam's lame performance along with his generic character, the film's (probably intentional) cheesiness in the latter half, the occasional appearance of bad dialogue and some unintentionally hilarious moments. Those flaws aside, Pacific Rim was great, loud fun filled with plenty of eye-candy, a brilliant performance by Idris Elba and great direction. If it weren't for the flaws, the film would have deserved a perfect score.
