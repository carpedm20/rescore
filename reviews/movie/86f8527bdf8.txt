For those of you who purchased the extended editions individually, you can still buy the box for all three movies.  There's a card inside the individual editions of Return of the King to order a box ONLY for the trilogy.  I know a lot of people who were planning on selling the first two movies and buying the Trilogy set.  Fortunately there is no need.  Outstanding added scenes as well as great bonus features!
