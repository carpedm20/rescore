I've read a couple of critical reviews of this movie and can't help but laugh at the disdain for this movie.  I don't see how people expected greatness and depth out of a movie with Jack Black set in prehistoric and biblical times.  I mean could they not see that by looking at the cover with a clean shaven, doe eyed Cera cast as a caveman?  You want comedic depth, go watch "Best in Show" or "Arrested Development".  You want silly and mindless toilet humor, then watch this.I didn't go into this movie expecting an Oscar worthy movie or ground breaking performance, in fact nobody should.  This movie is obviously intended for you to shut your brain down and let go for a couple of hours.  I really enjoyed this movie and love Black in these type of roles.  Cera plays the same role as he did in "Superbad" which isn't a bad thing since he's perfect as the shy awkward guy.  You get that this movie is going in a whole different direction from the on-set of the movie when the cavemen speak with current day dialogue.  It's right at that point where you're either sticking with it or bailing because even the most novice move watcher knows that this isn't "History of the World".  If you like stuff from the Apatow troupe then this movie might be up your alley.  If you don't get the Apatow reference then you obviously won't get this movie.
