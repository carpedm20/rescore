the movie that killed the trilogy i can never wach any of the matrix films after seeing this crap. like the second film i felt like i was getting beatin over the head with the whole choices crap that they just go on and freekin on about.it. yes we get it we got more then we wanted in the second film. nothing really felt right in this film at all . the final battle was anti climatic and the ending just sucked . if you only saw the first one or just the first 2 do not ever see the third one i can almost gaurantee you you'll never want to see any of them ever again.
