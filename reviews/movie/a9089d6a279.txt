Pacific Rim I love you! Going in, I was afraid that I would be seeing del Toro's first miss. Fortunately I didn't. It was stripped down and lean in story but it works to keep the roller coaster going and doesn't bog down in too much jibber-jabber or any tacked on love story. This not a film for the cynical or the meta crowd. This is escapism at its best. The fights were fun to watch, and felt real but big. The kaiju were very del Toro with Lovecraftian asides. This was a different and satisfying action film with a nod towards community. I have to see it again.
