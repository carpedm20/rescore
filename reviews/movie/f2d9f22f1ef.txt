 Completely over the top and overall very enjoyable. I loved it! Definitely worth seeing in IMAX 3D. My only complaint is about the woeful fake Australian accents, but Ron Perlman's character is so funny it just about makes up for that. And for those reviewers who complain about the "why" not being explained it most certainly is.
