I usually love crude humor, or can at least tolerate it. I love so-called "Black" comedies. I'm not easily offended, either. `Soul plane' is just down right stupid!, You'll probably never see another movie quite like this! Some would say that's a good thing, but as I watched this I caught a few laughs. I've seen some pimped out rides, but a pimped out plane? I think people are taking this movie a bit too seriously, or they don't know how, when or why to laugh at this specific type of cultural humor, this is very obviously a FUBU movie. This is another movie that just pokes fun at everything & everybody.Racial stereotypes and black/white culture are embraced rather than dispelled. Some of the jokes are forced and other's had there awkward moments. Tom Arnold can be fun to watch, although he has not made anything like that since 'True Lies' but in this movie he was just average. Snoop Dogg can be a lot of fun, even in bad films, but here he is one of the worst things on board even though he had some funny lines. Monique was her usual self in her role. Dwayne Adway is a bit weak in the leading role he needed to stick to being the straight man. Stewardess Sofia Vergara has landed in this film from being pictured on a footballer's arm. And like Francine Dee (who plays the Chinese stripper here) is another one of the models and women that have appeared as portraits by the GB artist and psychic Stephen Armourae. This film tries to be an Airplane spoof. But that in itself was a spoof. Double negatives don't work well.I'm sort of scared to even recommend this movie for purchase, I rather say rent it out first, just to be on the safe side. For all of you that like the black comedic-type films similar to some of the Wayans Brothers work, then this is the film for you. Prepare yourself for a crazy flight aboard the Soul Plane.
