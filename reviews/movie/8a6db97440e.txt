This movie was a ton of big action fun. The plot contains no real twists or turns that will throw anyone over 8 for a loop, but that doesn't hurt the brawny, intense fun in the film. The weakest part of the film was the male lead, who really doesn't emote or provide much of substance outside his 'rugged good looks'.Thank heaven for Idris Elba, who brings serious acting chops to the table and carries the emotional load of the film. Strongly recommended to big action fans, kaiju lovers and people who just want to have a good time watching fantastical monstrosities go at one another in big action scenes,
