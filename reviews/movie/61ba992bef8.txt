I'm really surprised by the low ratings. I'm definitely not a Jack Black fan (never was) but his performance here was pretty funny. Throw in actor Michael Cera, and you have yourself a pretty good film overall.Perhaps I'm just happy with the fact that Jack Black maintains his normal character compared to his other comedy roles and blends it with Michael Cera's typical character.  I recall how hilarious Michael was in Arrested Development, and I believe his performance here is quite similar. Now, like I said I'm no Jack Black fan, but taking his style and combining it with Michael Cera's really worked for me.The storyline itself (along with the source of humor) is extremely whacky, focusing on long long ago during the Biblical times (hence the name of the film) and basically making a mockery of the entire time period. I can see how some people would be offended I suppose, but for me, I'm not the least bit offended.In fact, the storyline is so outrageous that it's best to just treat the entire film as nothing more than a cheap comedy. That's all it really is anyway. Throw in some slapstick humor, and well, that just about sums it up.I just happened to find many of the segments absolutely hysterical. The two brothers beating the crap out of each other out in the field with the one rock-wielding brother not knowing when to stop, to the scene involving a potential "private part snipping", to the first time the two warriors experience what it's like to ride on wheels (which might honestly have some accuracy to it, you know). Entertainment the entire time.Again, not for everybody, and understandably so. But for me? Yeah, it did its job of entertaining me.
