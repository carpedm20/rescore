Although the film can get quite spotty and in many ways....droll, the action scenes coupled with the still top rate acting of it's major characters propels this movie to a solid an average 7. This movie could have been so much more than an action film in so many ways and at least a solid 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film alone. The B-rate extras fudging up some of the easiest lines in Hollywood history. The Matrix Revolutions answers many questions in this final installment in better ways than many other sci-fi films Terminator 3), but it fails to grip you the way the philosophy of the first Matrix did.
