The movie starts out strong with a hilarious ensemble cast of eccentric characters. Most of the Hoover family are living a frustrated and miserable existence as they try to make their individual "dreams come true." The only one who is isn't bitter is little 7 year old Olive who wants to win "The Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant. Olive isn't your typical beauty queen. But when the winner of her local pageant is unable to compete in the finals she is given her opportunity. Her father, Richard Hoover, is obsessed with winning. So he insists the family must make a last minute road trip to California so Olive can be a "winner."  The road trip portion of the film has it's funny moments. But does tend to bog down, as the family's mechanical troubles and other typical "wacky hi-jinks" aren't nearly as smart and original as the rest of the movie.The film really starts to run on all cylinders again when the family finally arrives at the pageant. Up until now the Hoover family had largely ignored the pageant world that little Olive longed to be a part of. But upon being exposed to the sick and twisted world of childhood beauty contests they are repulsed. At first they try to protect their daughter. But then allow her to participate so she can fulfill her "dream." By now they have finally realized the error of their self-centered ways and manage to unite as a family that loves and cares about each other.Along with the importance of family, the central theme of "Little Miss Sunshine" is about our society's obsession with "winners" and "losers". Their desire to be "winners" was actually making the Hoover family miserable. Only when they let go of this obsession with "winning" were the family able to come together and be happy. Brother Dwayne sums it up best when he says it's better to just do what you love and forget the rest. This is a sweet, charming and funny movie, definitely worth seeing.
