This movie is right on cue for so many things and on so many levels. Having worked in the airline industry myself, I especially appreciated all the jokes on the airline industry (ie. the security girls more concerned about their benefits rather than their measley pay, every airline/airport employee's mantra; the ticket agent at the counter playing a video game, airline travel becoming more like travel on a bus, etc. etc.).  But I don't want to get all deep and analytical. This movie's primary purpose is to be a comedy and boy, does it serve its purpose well. I was laughing nonstop throughout the whole movie, and the next day. I should stress that most of the humor is raunchy and is most definitely not for kids.As an endnote, yes there are stereotypes depicted in this movie, just as there are stereotypes sadly in our everyday life. I thought the director did an excellent job portraying them in an honest, fair way while poking fun at them.
