I wasn't expecting much from this film which I went to see in the holidays with my boy. That said we were both pleasantly surprised. It had a plot... It had a coherent thread running through the story as to where and why the kaiju came from... It was well acted... The special effects were second to none... It was thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable and satisfying. The quintessential blockbuster monster pic. Oh, and we both agreed Mako was extremely cute
