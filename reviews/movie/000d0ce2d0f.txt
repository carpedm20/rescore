Are you afraid to fly?  You will be after taking a ride on NWA.  Because you may die of non-stop laughter.  "Soul Plane" has stereotypical, obnoxious characters; raunchy, offensive humor; and an outlandish, unrealistic plot - everything that a comedy should have.  If you loved the disaster spoofs of the seventies and eighties such a "Airplane" and "Big Bus," then you will love this African-American version of the disaster epic "Airport."  "Soul Plane" has a racially diverse cast of very talented actors and rappers.  Among my favorites are Snoop Dogg, MoNique, and Tom Arnold.  Kevin Hart ("The Fifth Element") is Nashawn who is awarded 100 million in a lawsuit.  (He got his buttocks stuck on a toilet seat while his plane was lifting off and saw his beloved dog get sucked into an engine.)  He buys his own airline, NWA, which caters to African Americans.  The plane is painted purple, its wheels have large silver chromed hub caps, and it bounces up and down on the runway.  A disco and strip bar are on board.  Also, the passengers are segregated into either a plush high class or a subway-like, no thrills low class.  However, everyone is having fun until the pilot (Snoop Dogg) overdoses on drugs and dies.  I laughed from beginning to end.  I laughed until my ribs hurt.  Despite the laughter, my heart was warmed by the romantic story that unfolded in the background when Nashawn has a chance encounter with his ex-girlfriend Giselle.  He realizes that love is more important than money.  However, for a few dollars, you can buy "Soul Plane" and have a few hours of non-stop laughter.  This film is highly recommended for those who love hilarious spoofs, especially spoofs of disaster movies.  "Soul Plane" is guaranteed to lift your spirits until you are soaring through the sky, leaving your problems on the ground.
