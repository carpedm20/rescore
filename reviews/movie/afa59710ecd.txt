I saw this movie with really no high expectations because, well, it features mostly rappers -- most notably Method Man and Snoop Dogg. Basically, the movie is about a regular guy, Dakwon (Kevin Hart), who gets injured on an airplane; then he sues and wins a big cash settlement, and he decided to start his own airline, NWA Airlines, with the money.Like I said in the title, there ARE some funny moments in here, like when Snoop Dogg, who plays the pilot, says he's afraid of heights. But the movie starts to get really crazy when you see what's going on in different parts of the plane. Not that the craziness isn't funny, but it's like this: in one wing you see passengers riding in the seats; then in another wing you see a bar; then in ANOTHER wing there's a strip club; and in STILL another wing there's a casino, and I'm like, "How big IS this plane?"As far as the cast goes, I have no idea how Tom Arnold got in this movie. And the idea of his wife, son and daughter catching "jungle fever" (the son discovering hip-hop music and style; the wife and daughter picking up black men) is kind of played out -- especially since the way in which each of these things happen is semi-funny rather than COMPLETELY funny. And Method Man's acting performance in this movie was about as interesting as his performance in Belly.Speaking of Belly, this seems like another instance where a hip-hop video director tried to make a movie look like a lengthened version of one of his/her videos (it was directed by Jessy Terrero). That probably explains all the cameos, like D.L. Hughley as the bathroom attendant and John Witherspoon (what would a Black movie be without him?) as the blind man. This movie IS silly as probably planned, but I still think you can skip it.Anthony Rupert
