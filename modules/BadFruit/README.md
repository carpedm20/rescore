BadFruit Client For Rotten Tomatoes
===================================

This is a rough gem to interface with the Rotten Tomatoes API.

Prerequisites
-------------

	gem install badfruit

YOU ARE NOW READY TO GET SOME SWEET MOVIE DATA!

Usage
-----

So there are two main parts of the api, movies and lists. Each of these parts return movie objects, but they are in different contexts. For example. (bf is a BadFruit client instance).

	bf.lists.new_dvd_releases

Will return you an array of movie objects that represent that latest dvd releases. From this array you can execute actions on the individual movies themselves like...

	 movies = bf.lists.new_dvd_releases
	 movies[0].full_cast 
	 movies[0].reviews

Very similar to the actual movie section of the api which I've included an example below...

	 require 'badfruit'
	 bf = BadFruit.new("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
	 movies = bf.movies.search_by_name("Hackers")
	 cast = movies[0].full_cast
	 reviews = movies[0].reviews

This should get you started, I should also mention that there are probably more tweaks needed to the list part of the api, but it should work for most people. Feel free to contact me or open an issue if need be.

PLEASE NOTE: You will need to add replace the "API_KEY_HERE" text with your key to make the tests pass.

Version
--------
 The current version of the gem is 1.1.1, if you'd like to add anything feel free to submit a patch!
