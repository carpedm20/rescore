#rescore
[rescore](http://www.rescore.io) grew out of the idea that movie rating's were broken. How can something as complex as a movie be represented as a single score?

We don't think it's possible, luckily a solution is waiting in the wings - enter rescore!

rescore collects user reviews and reads them for you - keeping track of different factors, sentiment and cast members along the way. This information is then used to build a short expressive summary.
